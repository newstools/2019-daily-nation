Harambee Starlets opened their Council of East and Central African Football Association (Cecafa) Women Championship campaign with a 2-0 win over Ethiopia at Chamazi Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Sunday. Jentrix Shikangwa and Cynthia Shilwatso secured the win for Kenya who move top of Group 'B' pending the result between Uganda and Djibouti in the second match of the day. After a barren first half, Kenya opened the scoring in the 79th minute after Shikangwa was brought down in the the box. The midfielder picked herself up to convert the resultant penalty. Shilwatso doubled the score three minutes later to put the result beyond doubt. Kenya next play Djibouti on Tuesday at the same venue. On Monday, defending champions and hosts Tanzania play Burundi on Monday in their second Group 'A' game while South Sudan entertain Zanzibar.
