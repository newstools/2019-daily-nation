The High Court Wednesday ordered the electoral agency to release the voter register of Kibra constituency just hours before the start of the scheduled by-election. Justice James Makau ruled the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) violated the access to information law as well as the constitution when it failed to furnish Orange Democratic Party with a copy of the updated version of the Kibra voter register. Justice Makau ordered IEBC to release the list minus personal details of the constituents.
