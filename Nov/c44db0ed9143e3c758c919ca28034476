A middle-aged woman was found dead in a thicket in Gilgil, Nakuru County on Friday evening. The woman had been reported missing from her familyâ€™s home in Gitare village for seven days before locals stumbled on her lifeless body dumped in a thicket. George Kihanya, a local, said the mother of one appeared to have been raped before she was killed by her assailants. "The family has been searching for her since she went missing but their search mission was unsuccessful," he told the Nation. Mr Kihanya said they suspect the attackers might have been holding the woman hostage before killing her and dumping the body in the secluded place. The incident, he explained, has sent shockwaves among the villagers who are calling on the police to step up investigations and bring the killers to book. Gilgil Sub-County Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss Joseph Thuvi visited the scene in search of clues. "We are at the initial stages of the investigation and still piecing together the intelligence report," he said. The body was taken to the Gilgil Sub-County Hospital mortuary, awaiting postmortem.
