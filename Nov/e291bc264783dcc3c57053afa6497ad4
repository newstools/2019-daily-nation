Former Sofapaka striker John Avire has pulled out of the Harambee Stars squad that is set to face Egypt in 2021 Afcon qualifier on Thursday in Alexandria. The player has been at the centre of a transfer tussle between Sofapaka and Egyptian side Tanta SC for over two months now and heâ€™s yet to feature competitively after the Afcon tournament that was held in Egypt. Meanwhile, USA-based forward Boniface Muchiri joined the team in Egypt early Wednesday as they finalise their preparations for the game. Stars will then face Togo in their second qualifying match on Monday next week at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani.
