Sunday's Conference Cup at Ngong racecourse was undeniably a solitarily meticulous finish, rarely seen in subsequent events. All four contenders were collectively bunched until Harbour Bay (Henry Muya), and, White Dragon (Lesley Sercombe), took the initiative to press on gallantly, separated by a mere nostril. Owned and trained by Joe Muya up at Lake Nakuru, Harbour Bay has always been in the 'munty' with seven wins/eight places, to his name. Comic Star and Chicago both stamped their ground, effortlessly, for Lesley Sercombe. An aggregate of 15 lengths is nothing short of profound for young colts to excel at that rate. Chicago braced himself in the Chemurkeu Hot Springs Handicap, while Comic Star powered away at full stretch to reach Ol Kokwe Island, before anyone else realised what had happened. Have to declare that the Kenyatta Cup did not match its billing. Gold Pot (Charles Kimani) walked over Pharoah's Advocate, who smashed Caen. Zodi West never managed to become involved. Doctor Joe Wanjui presented the annual award to Justice Leanola, David/Maggie Gray, A. Helfritz, and, Doctor John Sercombe. NGONG RESULTS 12.40 pm - First Race - The Conference Cup  (2,400m) 1.
