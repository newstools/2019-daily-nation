He said the council has informed the family and subsequently notified the Teachers Service Commission (TSC). CONDOLENCES “The council wishes to send our heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, relatives and entire teaching fraternity for the loss of a dedicated professional in the education sector,” said the Knec chairman.

Quick processing of the exams has been attributed to OMR machine. It processes marked data from candidates’ answer sheets using specialised scanning.
