A Nairobi-bound SGR train was forced to make an emergency stop at Kibwezi Station after a passenger fell ill on board on Friday. A woman, who was in cabin 10, was taken off the train from Mombasa on a stretcher. Before she was taken out of the train, the SGR crew appealed to other passengers for a glucometer and a blood pressure gauge. Ms Purity Matu told Nation that the woman looked frail. â€œShe came in with her daughter, she looked weak," said Ms Matu. A few minutes to arrival in Nairobi the SGR crew announced that the patient was out of danger. The SGR crew later thanked doctors for assisting the passenger whom they said was out of danger.
