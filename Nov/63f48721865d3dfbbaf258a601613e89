Women activists in Isiolo County have decried rising cases of settlement of gender-based violence cases and asked police to arrest elders involved. Speaking during the launch of of the 16 days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign in Isiolo town, the activists noted that this move by parents is unfair to victims. “Elders involved in mediation should be arrested as settling the matters locally denies women, men and young girls justice,” said Ms Sarah Mwihaki, a children's rights activist. EMBARRASSMENT In most cases, parents do not report cases of crimes including female genital mutilation (FGM), defilement and rape for fear of embarrassing their families. The activists further pointed out that many boys and girls drop out of school or are forced into early marriage as a result of pregnancy. “We are appealing to parents to report violation of their rights and those of their children so that the legal process is followed for them to get justice,” said Ms Lydia Ntinyari of Isiolo Gender Watch. While blaming chiefs for tolerating FGM, the group asked local administrators to arrest parents who force their children to undergo the cut. The activists also also addressed drug and alcohol abuse and called for concerted efforts in dealing with the menace. ARRESTS Isiolo County Commissioner Joseph Kanyiri appealed to parents to work with police and administrators in arresting offenders. Mr Kanyiri directed chiefs to apprehend parents and guardians subjecting their daughters to circumcision during the holidays. “All chiefs must be on the lookout to ensure suspects in gender-based violence are arrested and prosecuted,” he said. Isiolo's acting Gender Affairs director Halima Suleiman called for multi-sectoral responses to the violence and full implementation of existing laws. He said there were gaps in promoting, protecting and achieving women rights and equality in the county.
