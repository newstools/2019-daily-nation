World Athletics CEO Jon Ridgeon responded to a letter from the “Global Throwing Group” complaining about Diamond League changes. The group had complained about the exclusion of discus from the 2020 Diamond League final programme and television broadcast, along with the steeplechase and 200 metres races. But in his open letter, Ridgeon argues that market demands forced the changes. “After 10 years of existence, the market demanded that the Diamond League product now evolve, as evidenced by the fact that the league has not enjoyed the presence of a title sponsor for the last eight years,” Ridgeon says. “As a result, we have listened to our broadcasters and fans and made changes, some of which were announced this week… “World Athletics (formerly International Association of Athletics Federations) has invested time and considerable funds to create a new strong one day meeting series — the World Athletics Continental Tour.”
