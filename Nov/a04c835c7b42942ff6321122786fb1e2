Former president Daniel Moi is back in Nairobi Hospital barely two days after he was discharged. Family spokesperson Lee Njiru says the former Head of State has been undergoing routine check-ups since Saturday, November 9. He said that Mzee Moi is admitted to the VIP wing, a homely setup, to facilitate check-ups and necessary treatment. “I appeal to the press fraternity not to cause unwarranted alarm by exploiting the credulity of the masses,” he said, adding, medical bulletins will be issued as and if necessary. Mr Njiru assured Kenyans that Mzee Moi’s health was stable. He added that the former president was “alert and being attended to by a professional medical team led by his personal physician Dr David Silverstein,” Mr Moi, who celebrated his 95th birthday last month, had been discharged from hospital last Thursday after two weeks of treatment, following chest complications.
