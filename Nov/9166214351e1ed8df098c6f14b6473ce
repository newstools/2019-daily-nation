January 1959. As the turbulent Emergency period declared by British colonialists to crush the Mau Mau independence movement entered a brutal seventh year, two unlikely lovers were initiating a rebellion of their own, which would attract international attention. He was a blind black man, and she was a white missionary who was once his teacher – and they had decided to get married, resisting a tide of opposition. In the manner of a Shakespearean romance plot laden with the unexpected, John Kimuyu, then 26, and Ruth Holloway, 35, fell in love in 1955 and got married four years later, even as white settlers proclaiming colonial racial segregation made desperate attempts to stop them.
