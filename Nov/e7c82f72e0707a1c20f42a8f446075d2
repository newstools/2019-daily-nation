A 71 year-old man was charged on Tuesday with defiling his 15-year-old granddaughter. The man is accused of committing the crime between November 20 and 24 at Nyangores Ward in Chepalungu Sub-county, Bomet. He lacked representation when he faced Senior Resident Magistrate Kipkirui Kibelion. The man denied the charge and was released on a cash bail of Sh150,000, but he could not raise the amount so he was remanded. The case will be mentioned on December 11 for setting of a hearing date. Mr Kibelion asked the prosecution to provide the accused with documents that will be used in the case. Rape and defilement cases have been in the rise in Bomet County with alcoholism, drug and substance abuse being cited as the main reasons.
