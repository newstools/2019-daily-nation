Delegates began arriving at the Bomas of Kenya early on Wednesday morning for the launch of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report. However, there was a commotion as people struggled to access the main auditorium. President Uhuru Kenyatta will launch the report that ushers a national discussion on the future of Kenya — which might shape, too, the Kenyatta succession and the 2022 politics.   The launch has brought together leaders from across the political divide. The report seeks to address issues identified as vital in building a stable and united Kenya. Among those present at Bomas are Cabinet Secretaries, governors, members of Parliament and County Assemblies, former legislators as well as leaders of political parties.   Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto and President Kenyatta arrived at Bomas in Karen in that order. Others present are ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, and Ford Kenya leader, who is also the Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula. Governors include Homa Bay's Cyprian Awiti, Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Mutua Alfred (Machakos). A host of former MPs --Erick Anyanga, Zakayo Cheruiyot, Ndungu Gethenji, Prof Philip Kaloki, Abdikadir Aden, Judith Sijeny, Abdiraham Ali, are among those present for the official unveiling of the BBI report.   Those lined up to address the delegates are MP Junet Mohamed, BBI Taskforce chairman Yusuf Haji, DP Ruto, and Mr Odinga before the President makes his address and officially launches the report.
