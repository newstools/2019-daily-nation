One person died in the fire incident that broke out at Brooke trading centre in Kericho Town on Tuesday night. Tens of other victims were rushed to Kericho County Referral Hospital where they were treated for various injuries sustained and discharged. The deceased is said to be a police officer whose business premise is one of those gutted by the fierce night inferno. "The police officer was burnt to death inside the premises which he recently opened after securing loan from a bank," said an administrator who sought anonymity since he is not authorised to speak to the press. Authorities say investigations on the cause of the fire are underway. His body was taken to the county referral hospital mortuary. DISASTER County police commanders are expected to issue a statement on the incident at mid-day Wednesday. The fire broke out at around 10pm destroying property of unknown value at the trading centre. Attempts to salvage property was futile as the fire spread quickly. Firefighting machines from the Kericho Government arrived as residents joined hands with police and county officers, pouring buckets of water to contain the inferno. Kenya Power switched off electricity supply to the area to avert further disaster. The supply was restored on Wednesday morning. "We slept in the cold after the fire consumed all our property and I do not know where my family will be accommodated today. We have lost everything," said Ms Rachel Chebet, a mother of three. Mr Noah Otieno, a resident said the fire spread fast because of the type of materials used in the construction of the semi-permanent buildings.
