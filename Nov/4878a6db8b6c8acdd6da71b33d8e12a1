A woman, her daughter and two grandchildren were burned to death after suspected arsonists set their house on fire in Nyunzu market, Makueni County. Regina Mueni, 49, succumbed to burn injuries she sustained in the 4am incident on Sunday, which also claimed the lives of her daughter Faith Mangeli, 27, and granddaughters, five-year-old Angel Masava, and Amelia Masava, aged two. Mueni’s mother, Monica Matolo, 75, sustained slight burns and was rushed to Makueni County Referral Hospital for treatment. Hours after the attack, furniture and household items of unknown value were still smouldering. “This is a clear case of arson. There was a strong smell of petrol on the smouldering debris,” Makueni County Commissioner, Mohammed Maalim said. Neighbours told the Nation that Ms Mangeli and her daughters had just travelled to her mother's place. Mueni had been at the centre of a protracted land dispute with her brothers. Sources privy to the land dispute said Mueni’s brothers were opposed to her claim on the family land. “The land dispute had been solved through the assistance of local administrators and a decision had been arrived that the land would be subdivided today (Sunday),” said Mr Maalim. Makueni sub-county Police Commander, Timothy Maina, said police have launched investigations into the incident. “The police are pursuing Ms Mueni’s brothers. They are the prime suspects,” Mr Maalim told the Nation. The four bodies were moved to Makueni County Referral Hospital mortuary.
