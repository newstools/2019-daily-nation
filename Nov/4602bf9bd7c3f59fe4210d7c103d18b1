Chaos, once again, rocked the Nairobi City County Assembly on Monday as police battled MCAs who wanted to eject Majority Leader Abdi Guyo from office. The county lawmakers allied to Speaker Beatrice Elachi last week staged a coup, replacing Mr Guyo with Dandora III MCA Charles Thuo. They also replaced Majority Whip Waithera Chege (South B) with nominated MCA June Ndegwa. In the 9am chaos, the MCAs engaged each other in running battles with the two rival factions accusing each other of causinng the mayhem. TEARGASMr Guyo claimed he was accosted on his way to the office by some goons who tried to block his access. They hurled teargas canisters at him and broke the door to his office in the process. “I don’t know how they got the teargas canisters. I want to ask those who want me out of office to follow the law. They should call for [the] Jubilee caucus and let the MCAs vote me out. They should not use shortcuts or goons to eject me out of office,” the Matopeni MCA added. PEPPER SPRAY The Elachi side, led by Mr Thuo, accused Mr Guyo of using goons and other individuals to stop him from performing his duties as the new Majority Leader. “He walked in with some goons and one of them even sprayed my eyes with pepper as I was discharging my duties as the Majority Leader even though members had overwhelmingly voted for me to take over the role,” Mr Thuo said. He alleged that Mr Guyo continues to disobey a court order and restricting Speaker Elachi from accessing her office and the chambers.
