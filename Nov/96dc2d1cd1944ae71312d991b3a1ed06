STRONG VALUES Head teacher Josleen Mugambi, who took over from long-serving Micheni Ragwa this year, said the school has established a culture of hard work and discipline. “While this is a drop from last year’s performance, we are happy that more than half of our candidates scored more than 400 marks," Ms Mugambi said. "It is not easy to remain at the top. We ensure we cover the syllabus extensively and that pupils are given sufficient time to revise." The school head also noted that teachers uphold high standards of discipline among learners, thereby creative a conducive environment for learning. She said they are always keen on breaking their records.   'SMALL ANT' Mr Ragwa said they took elaborate steps to shine, given that 'Kathigiri’ means ‘a very small ant’ in Kimeru. For about six years, Kathigiri had been flooring majority of the 30,000 public and private primary schools in the country. “When I joined the school in 2000, it had eight classes with a population of 64 pupils only. The environment was not good and there were no facilities. The name ‘kathigiri’ sounded too strange for a school," he said. "When I declared that the school would be in the top in one year, many laughed me off but we resolved to work as a team and [achieve this goal]." In 2000, the school became the most improved in Meru, having acquired 86 more points. “As they say, the rest is history. We started moving up the ladder of academic performance and in the last 10 years we have been among the top,” Mr Ragwa told the Nation. He also spoke of a culture of team work, hard work, positive competition among teachers and pupils and maximum teacher-pupil contact time.
