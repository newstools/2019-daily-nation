Ten more women were charged in Bomet on Wednesday with violating the law by undergoing female genital mutilation (FGM). Five elderly women were also charged with aiding the cut at Chebunyo in Chepalungu Sub-county, an area where the offence is rampant. The elderly women, said to be the victim's mothers, were arraigned separately following their arrest over the weekend. It was not clear whether the 10 women, aged 19 to 23, underwent FGM voluntarily or were forced into it. BABIES Some of the accused went to court with their babies in their arms. Before they were arraigned, they were taken to Longisa County Referral Hospital for checks. Those who did not have national identity cards underwent age assessment. PLEAS In a packed courtroom, the accused denied committing the crimes on November 23 at Kipsuter and Roborwo villages in Siongiroi and Chebunyo wards. Advocate Mercy Chirchir, standing in for Ms Brandy Koskei, applied for their release on bond saying they were not flight risks. Senior Resident Magistrate Kipkirui Kibelion released them, each on a bond of Sh50,000 with a surety of the same amount or a cash bail of Sh30,000. The case will be mentioned on December 11 for setting of a hearing date. The arraignment on Wednesday came a day after seven initiates and nine women appeared in the same court over the age-old practice outlawed by the government.
