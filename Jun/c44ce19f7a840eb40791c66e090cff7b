PARIS Reigning champion Simona Halep cruised into the Roland Garros fourth round on Saturday with a 6-2, 6-1 thrashing of Ukrainian 27th seed Lesia Tsurenko. The Romanian third seed broke serve eight times in a totally one-sided contest that lasted just 55 minutes to set up a last-16 tie with either Olympic champion Monica Puig or Polish teenager Iga Swiatek.
