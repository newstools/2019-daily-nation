At least five people are admitted to the Takaba Sub-County Hospital in Mandera after sustaining injuries during clan clashes in Burmayo along the Mandera-Wajir border. Mandera West Deputy County Commissioner Kipkoech Labatt said the injured had crossed into Wajir County in search of pasture and water for their livestock over the weekend. “Five people are being treated at Takaba Sub-County Hospital with different injuries after they clashed over grazing fields inside Wajir but the situation is calming,” he said. PEACE TALKS A team of peace ambassadors led by Mandera Public Service and Conflict Management CEC Ahmed Sheikh is already in the area for peace talks. “We have a team of peace committee members from Mandera meeting their Wajir counterparts to mitigate the situation that is delicate,” said Mr Labatt. Burumayo has been the cause for inter-clan clashes in Mandera pitting different clans as it is rich in pasture and water for livestock which most of the locals depend on for their livelihoods. According to the sub-county security committee boss, the situation has been contained as clans engage in talks on the need for peaceful co-existence.
