Liverpool are keen to tie Jurgen Klopp down to an extended contract after the club's Champions League triumph. Up to 750,000 fans welcomed the Liverpool manager - whose deal ends in 2022 - and his players home on Sunday after the 2-0 win over Spurs in Madrid. Klopp, 51, also oversaw a league campaign in which Liverpool lost only once to finish second on 97 points. "Jurgen is a brilliant coach but just as importantly he is a humble and caring man," said chairman Tom Werner. "When the players threw Jurgen in the air after our victory, they were acknowledging what all Liverpool fans know - he is beloved by all who appreciate football."
