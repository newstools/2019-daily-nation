An Isiolo court has released on a Sh400, 000 bond a man arrested ferrying three illegal immigrants in a car found with bhang worth Sh270,000. Mr Mohammud Mohamed Adan was arrested by officers manning a road block at Serolipi on the Isiolo-Moyale highway two weeks ago. The 107 stones of bhang wrapped in black polythene bags were being transported from Ethiopia and had been hidden in the vehicleâ€™s doors. Police also confiscated two kilograms of gemstones with a market value of Sh40,000. The accused was first arraigned last week but police sought more time to conclude investigations. The investigating officer asked for more time to allow the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit experts analyse call data records to establish if the suspect had links to terror groups. Appearing before Isiolo Chief Magistrate Samuel Mungai on Tuesday, Mr Mohamed pleaded not guilty to three charges of human trafficking, drug trafficking and being in possession of emerald gemstones. The case will be heard on August 14, 2019. The three Eritreans Ms Hinet Eyob, Eden Haile and Rodas Meron were last week charged before the same court with being in the country without valid documents. They pleaded guilty and told the court that they were on their way to Uganda where their parents live. The court directed that the illegal aliens be taken to Nairobi refugee agency to determine if they qualify for asylum. The case will be mentioned on June 20, 2019.
