He said security officers were still looking for the other missing colleague.

It was not clear if the missing officer was abducted and taken to Somalia by the Al-Shabaab militants. Seven officers died on Saturday after their vehicle run over an explosive between Kharof Harar and Konton centre. Two others, who sustained serious injuries, were airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment on Saturday night. “We have already buried the local officers according to Islam doctrine.
