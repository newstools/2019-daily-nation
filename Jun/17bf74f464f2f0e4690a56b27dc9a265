Police in Naivasha are holding a 26-year-old woman on suspicion that she had procured an abortion. Naivasha Sub-County Police Commander Samuel Waweru said the case was reported by her neighbours. He said the woman will Tuesday undergo a medical test to ascertain whether she aborted. “Neighbours claimed that the woman dumped the foetus in a pit latrine but we are yet to confirm that,” said Mr Waweru. A local leader, Bernard Macharia, said residents of Nyondia village informed him about the incident, prompting him to call the police. “According to her neighbours, the suspect had been threatening to abort, citing the high cost of living,” he said. Mr Macharia claimed the woman was pregnant and procured an abortion on Monday morning. The Naivasha police boss maintained that the woman will only be charged after results of the test are out.
