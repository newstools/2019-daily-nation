Kenyan gospel musician Mercy Masika has been appointed as the UN refugee agency’s national goodwill ambassador for Kenya. Before her appointment, Ms Masika served as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) high profile supporter, championing the agency’s LuQuLuQu campaign to change the narrative of the African refugee. “It is a great honour and joy to be given this appointment,” she said. “I intend to work in my role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador by relying on my faith as a child of God and my commitment to support people forced to flee.” In December last year, the Groove Awards winner participated in UNHCR’s Christmas campaign, calling on public support for refugees across Africa. “Refugees are just like you and me — they could in fact be any of us. I believe that, as an African community, we have a responsibility to invoke the spirit of Ubuntu; that we carry each other’s burdens by showing our warm heartedness in the face of a refugee’s struggle,” she said.
