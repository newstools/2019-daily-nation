Soi declared that age is just but a number saying he is ready once again to represent the country in Morocco with his eyes also focused on the World Championships planned from September 28 to October 6 in Doha, Qatar. "My last medal was at the 2012 World Indoor when I claimed bronze in 3,000m. I am eager to win medals for Kenya once again as I seek the transition to road racing and eventually full marathons," said Soi. Charles Mneria also clocked the African Games qualifying time of 28:18.06 but will have to wait for selectors decision since the first two athletes gained automatic qualification. The selectors will decide on the third qualifier.
