Harambee Stars coach Sebastien Migne has dropped Zesco United midfielder Anthony Akumu from the final 23-man squad for the Africa Cup of Nations which kicks off on June 22 in Cairo. South Africa-based defender Brian Mandela had already ruled out having picked up a knee injury on Monday, meaning Migne had three more players to trim from his initial 27-man squad that has been in France from May 30. Winger Christopher Mbamba will have to wait longer for his international debut. Portugal-based winger Clifton Miheso was the other casualty in Mign'e final squad although it is Akumu's axing that has shocked many fans. The combative midfielder has played a pivotal role for his Zambian club although he has not been a regular under Migne in the four qualifiers the Frenchman was in charge. Nation Sport understands that Mbamba picked up a knock on his ankle in training on Monday. Harambee Stars play Democratic Republic of Congo in their last build up match in Madrid on Saturday before heading to Cairo on June 19 for the Cup of Nations. Stars play Algeria in their opening Group C match on June 23 before tackling neighbours Tanzania four days later. They will wind up their group phase assignments against pre-tournament favourites Senegal on July 1.
