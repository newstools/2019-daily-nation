An bodaboda rider was on Saturday evening shot dead by suspected bandits in Garbatulla, Isiolo County, officials said. The 18-year-old man was on a motorcycle ferrying a man towards Escort area when two armed bandits intercepted them and opened fire. The passenger escaped unhurt and notified police about the incident but has since been arrested to help in investigation. “The man has been detained at Isiolo Police Station to help police in investigation into the matter,” Isiolo County Commissioner John Ondego said. The bandits are reported to have crossed over from neighbouring the Garissa County. Mr Ondego assured residents of security noting that police had been deployed at the area. “We sent our officers to secure the area immediately after receiving the alert,” said Mr Ondego. While terming it as a one-off case, the administrator asked bodaboda riders to exercise caution especially during nights and to avoid plying routes that are new to them. “Let them first confirm the area a client wants to be taken is safe before taking off especially during the night,” he said. He further pleaded with the residents of the area to volunteer information that would help in arresting the culprits. Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo condoled with the bereaved family and called on the government to hasten the disarmament exercise of National Police Reservists (NPR). The legislator attributed the fresh attack to withdrawal of firearms from NPR in the county claiming that their Garissa counterparts were still armed. “We need to unite as leaders and see how we can help secure our county,” said Ms Dullo during an interview with a local radio station.
