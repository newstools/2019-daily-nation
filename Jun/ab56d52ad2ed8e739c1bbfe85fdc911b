President Uhuru Kenyatta has restated his resolve to unite the country. The Head of State on Sunday called on leaders to stop unnecessary politics for the sake of national cohesion. The President who said national unity is the foundation for achieving the country’s development targets, promised to ensure that Kenyans are not divided along tribal, racial or religious lines. STRONG NATION “Our unity is our strength and foundation for building a strong nation. A nation that will be able to achieve its development targets so that the children of our children will remember that there was a time when Kenyans forgot tribalism, stopped corruption and built a country that provided jobs for the youth, drugs in hospitals and ensured no Kenyan slept hungry,” the President said at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, where he was the chief guest at the Annual General Conference of the Akurinu Churches Assembly. He emphasised the need for Kenyans to live together peacefully at the event also attended by Deputy President William Ruto. “We must learn to forgive one another, let us focus on the future instead of dwelling on the past,” the Head of State said. Dr Ruto urged all Kenyans to support the President’s call for unity. HUDUMA NAMBA “We will ensure this great nation is united. All Kenyans will rally behind you because you care for all of us,” Dr Ruto said. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko thanked President Kenyatta for ensuring that no religion in the country is discriminated against. The national chairman of the General Conference of Akurinu Churches Assembly, Archbishop Samuel Kinyanjui, said his church supports government programmes. Archbishop Kinyanjui cited the registration of Huduma Namba as an example of the programmes that the church embraced.
