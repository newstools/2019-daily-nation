Mombasa residents have blamed the county fire department for a minor's death on Thursday, saying fire fighters did not have water. The night fire at Chaani also left the occupants of a three-bedroom house counting losses as they could not salvage any property. The residents also accused the fire department and the county's disaster management unit of failing to respond on time. One Evelyn Wambua said, “We chased the fire fighters away since they could not put off the fire as they had no water. They had to call for a second engine." PREPARATION Senator Mohammed Faki asked the fire fighters and the disaster management unit to always prepare for such incidents. “There was a fire in Migadini, Changamwe. Fire engines were on site but they did not have enough water,” he said in an alert on Thursday. The unit has been on the spot in the recent past for not responding adequately to calamities. It has explained that in some cases, there are no access roads to the scenes. Mombasa Police Commander Johnstone Ipara said they were yet to establish the cause of the fire. He said an incident report would be released soon.
