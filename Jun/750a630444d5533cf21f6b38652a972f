Police in Kirinyaga on Saturday interrogated a German national who is accused of mistreating workers constructing Thiba Dam. Some employees of Strabag SE, an Austrian construction firm, accuse the foreigner, who works as a supervisor, of racial discrimination and physical assault. “He keeps hurling insults at us and calls us bushmen over trivial issues,” Mr Kennedy Maina, an employee of the firm, said. "He frequently accuses us of dragging our feet when working and attacks us,” Mr Maina added. Kirinyaga East police boss Antony Mbogo said one employee of the firm has filed an assault claim with authorities. He said investigation has been opened to establish the truth. James Karanja, a senior manager at  Stragbag, said the company is taking the allegations seriously. "We are investigating the matter and we will take disciplinary action against him if he is found culpable," said Mr Karanja.
