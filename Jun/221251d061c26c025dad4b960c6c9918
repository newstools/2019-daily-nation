A man was on Tuesday arraigned in Ukwala, Siaya for defiling a 13-year-old-girl. The suspect was accused of luring the minor to his house using maize before he defiled her. He denied the charges. Ugenya OCPD Willy Simba said the girl was rescued by neighbours who became suspicious after the Standard Six pupil took long to come out of the suspects house. “They found her hands and legs tied to the bed. Her mouth was covered with a piece of cloth,” a relative of the victim to the Nation.
