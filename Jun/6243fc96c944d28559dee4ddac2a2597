The budget committee of Nyandarua Members County Assembly and the assembly's services board are in a standoff over the local government's 2019/2020 budget. In an exclusive interview with the Nation, budget committee chairperson Kiiru Gachomba revealed that he was unable to table the budget proposal on Wednesday because the assembly service board failed to present and defend their budget estimates before the budget committee. BUDGET PROPOSAL "We are already done with executive part of the budget which we have harmonised to reflect the wishes of the cabinet, the MCAs, and the public,” said Mr Gachomba Ndaragwa Central Ward Representative David Maitai said a previous document from the assembly service board had a block figure, which the MCAs wanted itemised to ensure prudent and accountability by the board. Mr Gachomba said the board, chaired by Nyandarua County Assembly Speaker Wahome Ndegwa, has agreed to meet and present their budget on Monday for submissions, paving way for the tabling of the budget proposal next Thursday. Deputy Speaker Zachary Njeru is optimistic that the stalemate will be unlocked on Monday paving way for the final draft and tabling. “Budget making is a political process and such incidents are very normal. What matters is that we are still within the timelines and the budget-making process will be complete by end of the month as required by the law,” said Mr Njeru. NEW PROJECTS The assembly has proposed a budget of Sh783 million. It has also emerged that the ward reps want the introduction of Sh25 million for public participation forums in the 2019/2020 financial year. The funds will be raised by slashing budgets previously allocated for prayer day, staff training and the ongoing construction of the assembly office complex. If the proposal goes through, each of the 25 elected MCAs will get Sh1m to conduct public participation in respective wards, a move likely to cause further divisions between the elected and 14 nominated MCAs.
