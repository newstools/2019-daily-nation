Former Kamukunji MP and current legislator in the East African Assembly Simon Mbugua has filed a petition challenging the issuance of new currency notes unveiled on Saturday. The EALA lawmaker has accused the Central Bank of Kenya of failing to involve the members of the public before the notes were printed. Mr Mbugua wants the court to stop the roll out of the new banknotes pending hearing of the case. He has also complained over the use of the portrait of the founding president Jomo Kenyatta in the notes, arguing that it contravenes the Constitution. Mr Mbugua argues that the decision by CBK was made unilaterally and that the plan to withdraw Sh1,000 notes by October is punitive and prejudicial to the economy.
