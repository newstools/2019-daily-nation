Manchester United have signed England Under-21 right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace in a £50m ( Sh6.4 billion) deal. The 21-year-old, who made his first-team debut for Palace last year, has agreed a five-year contract that will earn him up to £80,000 a week. United are paying £45m up front, making Wan-Bissaka the club's fifth-biggest signing, behind Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku, Angel di Maria and Fred. He is the club's second summer recruit, after Daniel James joined from Swansea. Wales international James, 21, cost £15m. Wan-Bissaka, who has been on international duty this month at the European Under-21 Championship, joined Palace's academy when he was 11. The defender was on £10,000 a week at Selhurst Park, the lowest-paid player in Palace's first-team squad. His transfer was delayed by final negotiations between the clubs, which ended with the Eagles securing a 10% sell-on clause if Wan-Bissaka leaves United for more than £50m. The deal is yet to be formally announced by the Old Trafford club.
