A medical staff at the Kapkatet Sub-County Hospital in Kericho County has been arrested for allegedly raping a patient. The imaging sciences technician allegedly raped a 23-year-old female patient at the hospital in Bureti constituency, at around 11pm on Friday. The patient is said to have gone to the hospital for a CT scan over a persistent severe headache. ARRESTED The suspect allegedly injected her with sleep inducing drugs before raping her. Kericho County Police Commander James Mugera on Saturday evening confirmed the incident and the arrest of the suspect. “The suspect has been arrested from a hideout in Kericho town where he fled to after committing the offence. He is being held at Kericho Police Station as investigations are conducted before he is arraigned,” said Mr Mugera. The victim has undergone medical check-up and treatment at the same hospital. The woman, who has since recorded a statement at Kapkatet Police Station, is expected to undergo counselling. FORM TWO STUDENT In January last year, a Form Two student who was undergoing treatment at Kapkatet Hospital, was also defiled by an intern nurse. Dennis Kiplangat Bor was arraigned before Senior Magistrate Stephen Ngetich over the incident which occurred on January 27, 2018. The suspect who denied the rape charges, was released on a Sh200,000 bond and a surety of a similar amount. The case is still pending before the court.
