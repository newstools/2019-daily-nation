AFC Leopards coach Andre Casa Mbungo has offered midfielder Edward Seda a role on his technical bench. Mbungo's decision follows a move by Seda to abruptly retire from competitive football earlier this week at the age of 28. "He is a talented player and it is a shame we will not see him in his prime. But he has something to offer and I am willing to work with him in a different capacity," explained Mbungo, who is on holiday in Rwanda. Seda explained he's been forced to quit playing after failing to completely recover from a knee injury sustained during a league match between his club and Bandari last season. "This is the hardest decision to make," he explained "This injury had led me to consider my career and I have come to a conclusion that at this point I would wish to pursue other ventures." This was Seda's second stint at the club. He also turned out for Mathare United.
