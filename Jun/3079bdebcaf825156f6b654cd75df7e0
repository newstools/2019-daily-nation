Police in Uasin Gishu County have seized a consignment of polythene bags valued at Sh2 million. Addressing the press in Eldoret town on Friday, National Environment Management Authority (Nema) official Keziah Nangila said the banned carrier bags were impounded following a tip-off. POLYTHENE BAGS “Being in possession of banned polythene bags is contrary to the Gazette notice of February 28, 2017, the products were being transported to markets outside Uasin-Gishu,” said Ms Nangila. “It is unfortunate that there is still ready market for banned polythene bags. Those caught in the illegal business will be prosecuted, said Ms Nangila. She urged the public to stop using plastic bags. “We are trying to make our environment clean but some individuals are taking us back, we urge the public to use alternative carrier bags,” she added. Eldoret West Director of Criminal Investigations Officer Linah Maina said police found a truck ferrying part of the consignment in Ngeria on the Eldoret – Nakuru highway. The suspects then led the officers to a house in Eldoret’s West Indies estate where more polythene bags were found. BAN “So far, we have arrested the driver, his turn boy and their boss Mr Sanjay Gulabchand Dodhia,” said Ms Maina. Mr Dodhia admitted being the owner of the seized consignment. He, however, said he was working on the best method of disposing of the banned bags. “The polythene bags have expired and should be taken for recycling, we don’t sell them,” said Mr Dodhia. The officers appealed to local residents to assist the police in enforcing the ban on plastic bags.
