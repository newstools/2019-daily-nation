Talk about a one man show. Silverstone Air (James Muhindi), owned by Caotain M. Somow, demonstrated how a Concorde versus a Jumbo Jet, are really incomparable. Silverstone Air, had a full 2,800m to gather his thoughts, before walking smartly away with the Kenya St Leger Royal Artillery Cup, for trainers Joe Karari and Captain Oruya. Fast Five, La Cha Cha, and, Unforgettable, had their own miniature race for places, in another county. DISLOCATE ARM Visiting Zimbabwean jockey, Brendon McNaughton, peeled off advances from Tainted Love while riding Chyulu Hills, to snap the Resolution Harmony Handicap by a tidy head. Thereafter, poor young Brendon seemed to dislocate his arm while steering Sir Judson in the Champagne Stakes, rendering him unable to partake in remaining competition. Patsy Sercombe served owner Mim Haynes with a quartet of winners, saving one for Sarah Spencer. Exquisito! NGONG RESULTS 12.25 pm - First Race - Resolution Harmony Handicap (1,800m) 1.
