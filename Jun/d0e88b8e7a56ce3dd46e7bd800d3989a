LAWYERS Lawyers shortlisted are William Ondieki Mogaka, Joyce Majiwa, Joyce Miguda, Murshid Abdalla Mohammed and Josephine Kemunto. The Court of Appeal has had a shortage of judges due to the promotion of some judges including Chief Justice David Maraga, Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, who went to the Supreme Court and Kihara Kariuki, who is now the Attorney-General. The shortage also came about because of the retirement of some judges including Justices John Mwera, Anyara Emukule, Festus Azangalala and GBM Kariuki. Some 113 people had applied to be considered for the Court of Appeal positions but only 35 made the cut. According to the law, the JSC must ensure that not more than two-thirds of the members are of the same gender, and shall observe the principle of regional and ethnic balance. There are only seven women judges at the Court of Appeal.
