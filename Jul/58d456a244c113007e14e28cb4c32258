ThreeÂ  family members, among them a pastor and his wife, died on Saturday morning in an accident on Isiolo-Meru road. They had been heading from Isiolo to Mwingi, Kitui County, for a relative's burial when their vehicle collided head-on with another car at Maili Saba. They died at the scene while the pastor's son was taken to Isiolo County Referral Hospital with critical injuries. 'DRUNK' Buuri Sub-county Police Commander Joseph Asugo said the occupant of the other vehicle, a Catholic priest based in Isiolo, drove into the wrong lane. The priest may have been drunk, he said, adding he fled after the crash. The Nation established that a Catholic priest and seminarian escaped with minor injuries. "The priest and seminarian were later rushed to a nearby hospital and treated," a source said.   CAUTION The police boss asked motorists to be cautious. "All road users should observe traffic rules so that we don't lose lives," he said. Police towed the wreckage to Subuiga Police Station and took the bodies to the Isiolo hospital's morgue.   "WEIRD" Faithful of the African Inland Church in Isiolo described the incident as "weird". "We are so sad that we have lost our pastor and his wife at the same time. I was with them on Thursday," said one who did not want to be named. Mr Charles Kamau, who goes to the branch in Shambani, said, "We have lost a great man of God. We pray that God grants the family peace."
