According to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji, by January, a total of Sh19.7 billion had already been processed as advance payment for the Kimwarer and Arror dam projects, four years down the line, there is no evidence that land had been acquired for the projects. The funds paid are about 30 percent of the estimated project costs. DPP Haji said it was “a well-choreographer scheme by government officers in collusion with private individuals and institutions.” Here, in a simple explainer, we show how the billions of shillings were unjustifiably and illegally paid out. ------------------------- 1.
