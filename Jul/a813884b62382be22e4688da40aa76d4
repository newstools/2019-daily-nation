Kenya's national men's basketball team, Morans, on Thursday continued their historic run at the FIBA AfroCan tournament with a stunning 96-66 win over Morocco to sail through to the final of the tournament in Bamako, Mali. Kenya will now meet either Angola or Democratic Republic of Congo in the showdown for the title. The two sides were due to face off later Thursday in the other last-four encounter. Kenya, who had never played in this tournament outside the country before, beat Ivory Coast and Tunisia in the last 16 and quarter-finals respectively to set up the showdown against the Moroccans. Cliff Owuor's charges outlasted Tunisia 82-76 in overtime to storm into the semi-finals early Thursday morning. GREAT STREAK Kenya were never pushed to the limit as the Moroccans failed to match their energy from tip off. Ulinzi Warriors guard Erick Mutoro led the Kenyans with 32 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal in a +26 efficiency, while Sami Al Uariachi was Morocco’s main guy with 20 points and three rebounds. Kenya’s efficiency from the field is perhaps what gave them the edge over the North Africans. Owuor’s charges shot 46 percent from the field against Morocco’s 34 percent. The Kenyans also had a combined 26 assists to Morocco’s 15 and out-rebounded their opponents 49-40. Both teams were however sloppy with the ball with Kenya making 10 turnovers while Morocco had 13.
