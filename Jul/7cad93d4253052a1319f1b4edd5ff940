Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho has rubbished claims that he is the man behind an alleged assassination plot against Deputy President William Ruto. Speaking to journalists on Monday after launching a borehole at the Shauri Moyo Administration Police Camp, Mr Kibicho said that the saga is based solely on media reports. “I had hoped that you would ask me about the flow of water because that is what brought us here. I am very reserved about responding to useless and baseless allegations and because they are under police investigations,” he said, adding that allegations are solely from media reports. NO COMPLAINT He further explained that no formal complaints had been made against him. “You know I hear [of] assassination claims. Who has complained? I am yet to hear of someone who has complained. I think it is better to stop creating things that do not exist. The moment you say that we have a claim like that, that is formalised not in barazas, then it is dealt with in accordance with the law,” Dr Kibicho said. He added that his ministry would not be distracted from doing its work in light of the rumours. PS Kibicho went on to criticise a report released last week by Human Rights Watch on the state of extrajudicial killings in the country. POLICE KILLINGS The report had indicated that the police were involved in the killings of 21 suspects in two of Nairobi’s slums since August last year. He urged citizens to let the police do their work of investigating crimes without making assumptions as to who is responsible for committing them. Dr Kibicho had accompanied Water and Sanitation Principal Secretary Joseph Irungu during the commissioning of the borehole at the Shauri Moyo AP camp. The borehole, according to PS Irungu, is one out of 40 that are to be sunk within Nairobi in a bid to increase the amount of water available for usage in the county.
