A funeral service for the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth has been held at the Starehe Boys Centre in Nairobi. Students and alumni Wednesday turned up in their hundreds to pay their last respects to the MP who succumbed to cancer on Friday last week. The late Okoth did his Form Four at Starehe in 1995. At the same time, ODM party leader Raila Odinga and National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi were among political leaders who joined the late MP’s family at Silver Springs Hotel in Nairobi where final burial preparations were announced. FUNERAL SERVICES Speaking after a meeting with the family, Mr Odinga said the funeral services would kick off Wednesday afternoon with a two-hour service at Starehe Boys Centre.   “After deliberations with the family members and the set committee we have carefully decided to hold services considering that there will be a funeral for Bomet Governor,” said Mr Odinga. Another service will be held on Thursday at Moi Girls High School, Woodley in Kibera starting at 11am. “Viewing of the body will take place at the same venue,” he added. “The body will be given to Okoth’s family to deal with it, just like we did with Kenneth Matiba,” said Mr Odinga. He called for calm among the supporters of the MP, urging them to give the family time to mourn and give their son a descent send-off. Speaker Muturi said his presence was to show support to the bereaved family. “We are here to show support to the family during this difficult time,” he said.  Additional reporting by Anita Chepkoech
