The University of Nairobi (UoN) council has appointed Prof Isaac Mbeche as acting vice-chancellor. This comes days after the UoN council rejected Prof Peter Mbithi's bid for automatic reappointment as VC for a second term. “The Council wishes to take this opportunity to reassure the University of Nairobi community and all Stakeholders that it is in charge and there is no cause for alarm,” said council chair Julia Ojiambo in a communication to staff and students. Prior to this appointment, Prof Mbeche was the deputy vice-chancellor in charge of finance, planning and development department. Prof Ojiambo said Prof Mbithi will go on leave on July 6 to allow for an effective appointment process of a new vice-chancellor.
