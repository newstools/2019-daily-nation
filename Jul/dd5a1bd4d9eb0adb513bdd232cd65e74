R. Kelly has been arrested on child pornography and other charges, the New York Times reported, in the latest criminal investigation into the R&B superstar dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct. The 52-year-old, whose legal name is Robert Kelly, was taken into custody by federal agents in Chicago late Thursday, the newspaper said. Federal prosecutors have issued a 13-count indictment against the singer, which also includes enticement of a minor and obstruction of justice charges, the newspaper reported. Kelly has a decades-long history of abuse allegations, especially of underage girls. He was acquitted in a child porn trial over a decade ago, and had maintained a steady fan base and continued to perform. Prior to Thursday's arrest, Kelly was on bail for a slate of charges in Chicago, including five felony counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault. If convicted of the most serious charges in that case, Kelly would face mandatory sentences of six to 30 years in prison on each count. In a March interview, Kelly vehemently denied the charges and said he was "fighting" for his life. "I didn't do this stuff," Kelly told CBS News.
