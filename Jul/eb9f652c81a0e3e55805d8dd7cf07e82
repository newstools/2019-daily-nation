The Kenya National Union of Teachers wants dismissal of a request seeking to suspend a decision that granted tutors reprieve on promotions and career progression. While responding to a case filed by the Teachers Service Commission, Knut told the court on Monday that the reasons it gave were frivolous. According to the TSC, no prejudice will be suffered if the decision remains as per the judgment issued on July 12 even as the commission intends to take the row to the Court of Appeal. “The application for stay of execution of this judgment should be denied and the case dismissed,” Knut said. In documents filed at the court, the union said the commission’s request would ultimately make the matter remain unresolved, a situation that would most likely lead to strikes.
