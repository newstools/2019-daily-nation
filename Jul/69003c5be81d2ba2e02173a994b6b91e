LONDON Newly-installed Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday named Brexit hardliner Dominic Raab to be Britain's foreign secretary, the government said in a statement. Raab, 45, who was also named as Johnson's effective deputy, resigned as Brexit minister in Theresa May's government last year saying the divorce deal she struck with Brussels offered too many compromises.
