Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok on Tuesday night dismissed reports that he is hospitalised as disinformation. Mr Nanok told a Nation reporter, through a text message, that says he is doing fine and at home. "I am well and at home. Other media publishing I have a mild stroke are telling untruth." Mr Nanok said. Through his official Twitter page, Mr Nanok said that nobody should wish 'mild stroke' on him or anyone else. The Council of Governors also termed the reports as fake news. Turkana County Director of Communication John Emeripus said that the governor was on official duty Tuesday. Mr Emeripus urged Kenyans and Turkana County residents to ignore the reports dismissing them as fake and ill motivated.
