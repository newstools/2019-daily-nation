IN NAIVASHA Four-time winner of the Kenya’s premiere event Carl Tundo is the overnight leader of the 2019 KCB Safari Rally as the World’s famous round of the competition heads for the action on the Day Two of the programme Saturday morning. Former winners of the event, Baldev Chager and Ravi Soni finished in the 10th place at the end of 4.5km spectator stage. "We were slowed down by the dust from Onkar Rai’s car. We actually stopped briefly before we continued with the competition. Luckily, no other problem. Action starts tomorrow (today)," Soni told Nation Sport.   Zambia’s Leroy Gomes was the best-placed foreign driver in second place, driving a Ford Fiesta with his wife Ushlla Gomes as his navigator. For some drivers, transport section from Nairobi to Sopa Lodge was one of the most uncomfortable stretches in a rally. “It was one of the longest stages to drive on transport. 150kms in a rally on transport section is not one of the best funs seated in a rally car. It was a rough ride,” said one senior driver. The distance was forced upon the organisers after the cancellation of the second competitive stage. Jonathan Somen and Richard Hechle spun their Ford Escort MKII at the Kasarani Super Special Stage on stage. Luckily both drivers were unhurt and are still running in the competition. The second stage will start at 7am from the Sopa Lodge in Naivasha before tackling three competitive stages that will be repeated twice. Cars will enter the first competitive stage through Soysambu at 8.51am followed by Elementaita at 9.29am and Sleeping Warrior at 10.07am respectively. These stages will be done again at 1.55pm, 2.33pm and 3.11pm before returning to Sopa Lodge for an overnight rest halt. The Safari was part of the WRC until 2002 when it was scrapped off the calendar due to financial problems and poor organisation. It has been part of the African Rally Championship (ARC) since 2003. However, the Kenyan government is trying to ensure the rally is restored to its WRC status. And there is huge hope in that regard with all signs showing that it could make a return to the WRC in 2020. Prior to the start of the big event, President Uhuru Kenyatta presented a cheque of Sh440 million to Phineas Kimathi, the CEO of the Safari Rally WRC Project as part of the deal to help Kenya regain the World Rally Championship status for the 2020 season.
