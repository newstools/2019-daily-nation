Silverstone Air with regular jockey James Muhindi, faced a stiffer task force in the Jockey Club Stakes at Ngong racecourse on Sunday, but overcame the older generation's ideals, with self-assurance. Western Ballad renewed her startling Triple Crown era, in an attempt to de-rail Captain Somow's, Silverstone Air, only failing by less than a couple of lengths. Public Hero and Clothes Horse, simmered behind, but Notorious ran dry of fuel. Harbour Bay (Josphat Kultiang), allowed a sedate gallop to play to his strengths in the Kenya Cambridgeshire, enabling a real crunching of Fast Five.   Joe Muya's stable has certainly perked up this season. He quickly produced a double from La Cha Cha in the Jason Dunford (Olympic swimmer) Handicap. Oliver Gray's, Algy (James Muhindi), for Lord Stuart Rose, deprived Inca Ruler by a mere head in the Zarika Maiden. It was the tightest finish of all 8 races. River Run (Patrick Mungai), kicked on early to the Lemy Mwenda handicap post, outpacing a well-spent Choc Chip, for five buoyant owners. With a verve to suggest Navy Seal has returned safely to winning ways, defying 60 kgs, he changed the JCK Rose Bowl perspective, where others were more fancied. Lesley's Sercombe definitely assisted in Navy Seal's thinking process. She immediately created a double on Lady Eccles in the Sir Ali Bin Salim, leaving Compadre completely polarised.
