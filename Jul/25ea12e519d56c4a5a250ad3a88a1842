President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to attend the traditional wedding of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru and city lawyer Kamotho Waiganjo. Ms Waiguru and Mr Waiganjo met 10 years ago in a ferry in Likoni, Mombasa County, while travelling to a conference on the Constitution. Guests arrived early for the event taking place at Kiamugumo Primary School in Gichugu constituency. So far, those present include Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga, Cabinet and principal secretaries and at least 30 members of Parliament including woman representatives Florence Mutua (Busia) and Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay). The lawmakers said they were excited and described the event as well-organised. There are two tents - one for dignitaries and the other for the public - and the presence of police, including the General Service Unit, is heavy. Preparations included upgrading the road leading to the school and mounting screens to ensure all guests follow proceedings. Ms Mutua said, "We have come from far and wide to witness and celebrate the wedding of our friend." Deputy President William Ruto is also expected at the function.
