The trader panicked and gave out the cash but they opened fire on him as they took off," said an eyewitness/. A local resident, Mr John Gachoki, said he was at home when he heard gunshots and rushed to the scene only to find the victim bleeding. After the robbery, the raiders escaped towards Kutus town in a Probox car believed to have been stolen elsewhere.
