Students from St Stephen Kavutiri Boys Secondary School in Embu County on Tuesday went on strike and destroyed property of indeterminate value for reasons yet to be determined. They rioted shortly after night preps and pelted buildings with stones and breaking the windows before walking out of the school. Embu County Police Commander Daniel Rukanga said some of them might be charged once investigations are complete.
