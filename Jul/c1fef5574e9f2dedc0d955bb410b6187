The firm says the card can be used worldwide at all visa accepted ATM's points, at all points of sale and online shopping platforms. The lender’s Shariah Supervisory Board Member Prof Mohammed Badamana said that a fixed fee will be charged to customers for various services such as maintenance of the account, continued usage of the card, along with benefits such as discounts with partner institutions. The card will not be charged on any floating percentage fee that is dependent on the outstanding balance. “The entire fee structure is based on a fixed fee with the banks discretion to reduce the fee unlike the conventional cards where the fee is a percentage of the outstanding amount,” he said.

This payment will not be part of the banks income rather it will be donated to the GAB Foundation that supports various social empowerments.”
