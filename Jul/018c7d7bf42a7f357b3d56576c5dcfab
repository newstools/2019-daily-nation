Harambee Stars held Tanzania to a barren draw in the first leg of the first round Africa Nations Championships (Chan) qualifier at National stadium, Dar es Salaam on Sunday. The result places Sebastien Migne's charges in good stead of proceeding to the second and final qualifying round if they pick a win of any kind in the return leg to be played in Nairobi next Sunday. Kenya was lucky to escape from Tanzania unscathed as the hosts enjoyed a lion’s share of possession, especially in the first half, but failed to score. The aggregate winner of the first round will face Sudan in the second round. The second round winner will qualify for Chan 2020, the sixth edition which will be held January next year in Cameroon. While Kenya is seeking to make to the 16-team competition for the first time in history, Tanzania and Sudan have already been there. Tanzania’s only appearance was in the inaugural event in 2009 saw them exit at the group stage. Sudan bagged bronze medals in 2011 at their backyard and in last year's edition in Morocco.
