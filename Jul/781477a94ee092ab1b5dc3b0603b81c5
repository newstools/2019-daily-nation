Dr. Laboso, whom I served very closely with, and who offered me great support during my first term as the Speaker of the National Assembly, has been a huge inspiration to women in leadership; a real trailblazer who stood tall and soldiered on to make history as the first woman governor of Bomet County, having achieved another first when she got elected the first woman deputy Speaker of the National Assembly in the 11th Parliament.

Despite her busy schedule as the Governor of Bomet, she still found time to dedicate to LREB which drew a lot of richness from her vast experience in management.

May the Almighty grant her soul perpetual rest. BARINGO SENATOR GIDEON MOI: It is with great sadness that I have learnt of the death of Bomet Governor Dr. Joyce Laboso. Being among the first crop of female Governors elected in 2017, she gave hope to the girl child that it was possible to fight for and occupy such political offices which in the first dispensation of devolution was only occupied by men. Her loss thus is a blow not only to her family but also to women leadership in the country. On behalf of myself, my family and the people of Baringo, I pray to God to give the family necessary fortitude during this time of loss.
