Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich and the Principal Secretary Kamau Thugge have been charged in court over the multibillion-shilling Kimwarer and Arror dams scandal. The two officials among more than 10 others have been charged Tuesday with multiple counts including abuse of office, conspiracy to commit an economic crime, conferring a benefit and single sourcing for the insurance of the projects, and approving payment contrary to the law. They are charged separately for Arror and Kimwarer dams projects. The court heard that they engaged in a project for the construction of Kimwarer multipurpose dam, without prior planning. They denied all the charges. On Monday, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji ordered the prosecution of 28 individuals, among them officials from the National Treasury, Ministry of East Africa Community, National Environment Management Authority, Kerio Valley Development Authority and Inspectorate of State Corporations.   The government officials were arrested on Monday after being accused of conspiring to steal over Sh17 billion.   They were presented at the Milimani Law Courts on Tuesday morning before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. Legislators who are present in court are Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, William Chepkut (MP Ainabkoi), William Cheptumo (MP Baringo North) and Uasin Gishu Woman representative Gladys Shollei.   The arrested officials had been locked up at Muthaiga Police Station and on Tuesday held in the court basement cells before being arraigned. The prosecution team is led by special prosecutor Taib Ali Taib, Alexander Muteti and Emily Kamau, among others.
