IN KIGALI, RWANDA Kampala City Council Authority (KCCA) were on Sunday deservedly crowned the Council of East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa) Kagame Cup champions after a 1-0 win over Tanzania's Azam as this two week competition drew to a close at the Stade Kigali. Ultimately, the Ugandan champions proved the best of the 16 clubs competing in this tournament which also offered several lessons for Kenyan stakeholders. KCCA won in all its seven engagements at this tournament bar one - versus Kenya's Bandari at the Huye Stadium - which ended 1-1 during the opening stages of this competition. The wins were recorded against hosts Mukura Victory and Rayon Sport, plus twice against defending champions Azam, and another over Zambia's Green Eagles in extra time. "It was a befitting success after a long spell of hard work behind the scenes," explained KCCA coach Mike Mutebi.
