Kamworor, the two-time World Half Marathon champion, won in 27:50:65, followed by Josephat Bett 28:40:58, Joseph Kitum 28:40:74 and Mathew Kisorio 28:44:63. As the rest of the pack was hitting the bell, Kamworor, the 2015 World 10,000m silver medallist, was taking the last bend to claim for his fourth Police title. The 26-year-old, who broke away from the pack in the 12th lap, has kept his options for the Doha World Championships open. "It was a good race though no threat or challenge. I was gauging my strength to see whether I can return to track for the World Championships," said Kamworor.
