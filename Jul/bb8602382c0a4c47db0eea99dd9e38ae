Eunice Kadogo and Peter Mwai are the 2019 National Police Service Athletics Championship women and men's 100m champions. Kadogo recovered from a slow start to stun defending champion and national record holder Maximilla Imali on the line. Kadogo, who is in the 200m team for the African Games, clocked 11.69 seconds beating Imali to second place in 11.73. "I am glad to reclaim my title despite my poor reaction. It could have been better, " said Kadogo. Graceful in defeat, Imali said she couldn't push hard owing to some muscle strain. "I felt some pain in my leg midway but I will be fine," said Imali. Millicent Ndoro came in third in 11.86 with Freshia Mwangi taking fourth place in 12.23. Mwai also recovered from a poor start, to hit the front midway before winning in 10.62. John Sirengo came in second in 10.87 with John Cheruiyot going for third place in 11.08.
