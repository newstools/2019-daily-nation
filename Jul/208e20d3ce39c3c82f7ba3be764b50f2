A judge has issued arrest warrants for Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o and his sister Risper Nyagoy for contempt of court. High Court Justice Tripsisa Cherere ordered Thursday that the Kisumu County Commander Benson Maweu execute the arrests. She also committed the two to civil jail for one month. The duo was found guilty of disobeying several court orders in an estate row pitting them against their nephews. On October 11, 2018 Justice Cherere ordered them to submit books of account of their father's Hesbone Shimei Nyong’o multimillion-shilling estate after they were sued by their nephews for failing to include them on the inheritance list. Prof Nyong'o and Dr Nyagoy neither obeyed the orders nor appeared in court. Justice Cherere fined them Sh400,000 each for contempt of court on May 30, 2019. She also ordered that they pay Sh50,000 for every month they fail to submit the books of account. APPEAL The property in contention is estimated to be worth more than Sh200 million and includes 100 acres of land in Miwani and flats along Jogoo Road in Nairobi. Others are parcels of land in Manyatta, Tamu, Milimani and East Rata in Seme Sub-County, Kisumu. The governor had filed an appeal after the October ruling which is yet to be determined. “We have not been wilfully disobedient. We feel we should be given time to allow hearing of the application filed in the court of appeal,” Prof Nyong’o's lawyer Mr Chacha Odera said on behalf of his client Thursday. But this was dismissed by Justice Cherere who maintained that they have been disobeying court directives and that they did not have a stay order stopping the ruling. Mr Odera indicated that his client will not appeal against the Thursday's judgement and will instead wait for the hearing of the case on Tuesday at the Court of Appeal in Kisumu.
