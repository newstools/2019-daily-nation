Sofapaka midfielder Dennis Odhiambo will captain Harambee Stars on Sunday when they face Tanzania away in the first leg of their African Nations Championships (Chan) qualifier. After missing out in the team that performed duty for the national team in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), midfielder Clifton Miheso finally made it to the 22-man squad that coach Sebastien Migne named on Friday. Mathare United defender Johnstone Omurwa, who was called up to the national team midweek, also made it to the final list together with Kenya Under-20 winger Musa Masika. Masika, who plies his trade at Wazito, will be looking to make his senior debut in the encounter. In the championship, Migne will miss almost half of the team that featured at Afcon because only local-based players are allowed to take part. The return leg will be held in Nairobi on August 4.
