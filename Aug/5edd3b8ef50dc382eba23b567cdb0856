Detectives have arrested two prison wardens after footage showed them hiding huge amounts of cocaine. The officers identified as William Chengo and Boniface Kipkorir were captured on CCTV camera on Monday hiding the drugs in a toilet at the Manyani Maximum Security Prison in Voi, Taita Taveta County. The two were also found in possession of ammunition without authority. Confirming the incident, the prison's officer in charge Mr Bison Madegwa said the officers were handed over to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) for further investigations and prosecution. "We facilitated the DCI with the relevant information and handed over the officers to them for further action," he said. RESHUFFLE Last month, another prison warden was arrested at the facility while smuggling cocaine to the inmates. The officer has since been interdicted as investigations into a cartel that has been supplying contraband items to inmates continyes. Over 30 officers have also been transferred in connection to smuggling contraband items to the prisoners. Thousands of mobile phones have also been confiscated in the crackdown. The inmates have been using the phones to con unsuspecting members of the public and even to organise crime while in prison. Since the crackdown started some inmates addicted to drugs have developed withdrawal symptoms forcing the prison management to provide detoxification measures and treatment. DRUG WAR The operation against drug traffickers comes after Dr Matiang'i on Sunday renewed the war against drugs at the Coast. He said drugs were responsible for the increase of killer gangs that have been terrorising residents. Dr Matiang'i warned that dealing with drug traffickers would be “a painful journey”.
