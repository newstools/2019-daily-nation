The Standard Chartered Nairobi Marathon has reverted to its traditional starting and finishing points at the Nyayo National Stadium. The 17th edition of the country’s premier marathon race will be staged on October 27, this year. Local Organising Committee chairman Peter Gitau disclosed Thursday that the 42km, 21km and 10km races will start long Uhuru Highway opposition the Nyayo National Stadium, before trickling back for the finish inside the arena but at varying points. Haile Selassie Avenue opposite Railway Club, Nairobi was the start and finish points for 2017 edition after the Nyayo National Stadium was closed for renovation, with the 2018 races starting and ending at Uhuru Park processional way. “Nyayo National Stadium is much better for logistical planning and we are glad to return to the venue,” said Gitau, adding that the route will remain as it was during the 2016 when the races started at the venue. Gitau said they have introduced a new Corporate Challenge Relay race that will feature five contestants in each team to revamp the CEO race to make it six the number of races on card. The contestants will in the end cover 42km. Besides the 42km, 21km, 10km and relay races, there will also be the 21km wheelchair and the usual 5km family fun race.
