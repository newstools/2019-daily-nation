Detectives in Mombasa on Saturday seized 2.9 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil worth Sh11 million. Two suspects, among them a Tanzanian, were arrested during the early morning operation in Barsheba, Kisauni sub-county. The suspects Mr Mujib Suleiman and Mr Saady Bashur Omar, a Tanzanian, are being detained at the Mombasa Port Police Station. BLACK SUITCASE The hard drug, which was stashed in a black suitcase, was brought from Brazil. The consignment passed through Sudan before being taken to Uganda, then to Nairobi and finally to Mombasa. Coast Directorate of Criminal Investigation Washington Njiru said the drugs were found in a compartment of a suitcase which had an assortment of cloths. “The operation was conducted by a multi-agency team at around 4am following a tip-off,” said Mr Njiru. BRAZIL An intelligence report obtained by the Nation said the detectives had trailed the traffickers from Brazil for months. The report indicates that Mr Suleiman has been operating a well-organized drug distribution network in the coastal towns of Mombasa and Malindi town in Kilifi. “The network targets local users and tourists. It is suspected that Mr Mujib works closely with a known village elder in Mtwapa who supervises his business while pretending to be offering protection,” reads the report in part.
