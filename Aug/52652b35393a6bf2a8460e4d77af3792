The suspect identified as Mohamed Rashid Mwatsumiro alias Msanii was killed in his house during the police raid. Police corporal Jeremiah Mula was shot in the stomach and rushed to Diani Hospital for treatment. A police brief seen by Nation showed that the officer was in stable condition. Kwale County Police Commander Tom Odero said a pistol was recovered from the suspect's house. "We had been following the suspect who was fatally injured during our operation," said Mr Odero.   KILLERS He said the suspect is linked to the recent killings of village elder Bakari Dondo and a Muslim cleric Shee Fumbwe in Mabokoni village, Msambweni Sub-County.
