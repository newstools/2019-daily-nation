Hearing of Willie Kimani murder case on Thursday took a new twist after the Law Society of Kenya claimed defence lawyer Cliff Ombeta is not licensed. LSK, with a membership of over 14,000 practising advocates, is Kenya’s premier bar association. LSK lawyer Stephen Ongaro told Judge Jessie Lessit that Mr Ombeta's certificate had been withdrawn since he had yet to renew his practising licence. Mr Ongaro added that the defence lawyer has not earned enough Continuing Legal Education (CLE) points, to enable him to renew his permit. Mr Ombeta represents three police officers among five people accused of killing lawyer Kimani, his client and a taxi driver in 2016. Kimani, a human rights advocate, was an LSK member and the lawyer's body is an interested party in the case. The claims were, however, disputed by Mr Ombeta's advocate Doreen Kali, saying he is still on LSK roll and his status is active on the website of the lawyers’ body.
