Homa Bay County Commissioner Herman Shambi's residence was on Sunday evening destroyed by fire. Mr Shambi, however, said the cause of the inferno was yet to be established. The administrator said he was taking evening tea with his family when they detected smoke in one of the bed rooms. "We tried putting out the fire using water but we did not succeed as it quickly spread to other rooms," he said. He said he lost everything in the inferno including his certificates, clothes and other critical documents. "No one was hurt, we are all fine except for the children who got a little scared," the administrator said. SCARED Residents, who arrived at the scene, managed to salvage a few furniture. The fire destroyed the one storey house which is located behind the Homa Bay County Assembly. Water trucks were used in putting out the fire which had consumed much of the building. Mr Shambi has served in Homa Bay for two months since taking over from Mr Irungu Macharia who moved to Lamu County. Homa Bay town residents on Sunday demanded answers from the county government on the where bouts of the two recently acquired fire engines. Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata announced three months ago that they had acquired firefighting machines.
