The Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) women’s volleyball team started the 12th edition of East African Military Games on the wrong footing after losing to neighbours Uganda at the Kasarani Indoor Arena on Wednesday. Uganda waded a spirited fight from the hosts in the second set to win the opener in straight sets (25-18, 26-24, 25-20). In an earlier match played at the same venue, Rwanda proved too good for Tanzania blanking them 3-0 (25-21, 25-15, 25-18). In netball matches played at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies, Tanzania beat Rwanda 66-16 (3-15, 1-16, 6-18,6-17) while Uganda thrashed Burundi 114-9. In basketball, Burundi edged Tanzania 79-75 while Rwanda overcame Uganda 77-64. In football, Erneste Subira scored a delightful free kick just before the break as Rwanda Defence Forces won 1-0 against hard-fighting Uganda People’s Forces.
