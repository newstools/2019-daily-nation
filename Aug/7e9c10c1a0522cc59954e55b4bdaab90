Police have arrested four people as authorities battle to contain chaos that has rocked Knut House. The fracas erupted at the headquarters of the Kenya National Union of Teachers in Nairobi Thursday morning after some executive members turned up for a meeting to fire embattled Secretary-General Wilson Sossion. The National Executive Council members were seeking to hold the meeting even after it was stopped by the Labour Court on Wednesday. The executives forced their way into Knut House on Mfangano Street. It was not immediately clear if the secretary-general, who is also a nominated MP, Â was in the office when the officials stormed the building. OUSTER The charging officials were later restrained by police officers who deployed to the scene a few minutes after 9am. Justice Byram Ongaya on Wednesday temporarily stopped the meeting after Mr Sossion filed an urgent application. Through lawyer Judith Guserwa, Mr Sossion argued that some NEC members were planning to illegally remove him from office. Ms Guserwa said NEC members have no power under the Knut constitution to convene or proceed with a council meeting that has been postponed. However, the Knut officials on Thursday insisted that Mr Sossion must leave the union, blaming him for their troubles with the Teachers Service Commission, their employer.
