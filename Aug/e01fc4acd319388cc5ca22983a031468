MOGADISHU The mayor of Somalia's capital Mogadishu has died of wounds sustained in a militant bombing attack on his office last month, the government said on Thursday. Mayor Abdirahman Omar Osman died while doctors were treating his wounds at a hospital in Doha, a spokesman for the Somali president's office said. Six people were killed and Osman was seriously wounded in the July 24 attack on a government building claimed by Al-Shabaab jihadists to have been targeting a UN envoy. Abdinur Mohamed Ahmed, a spokesman for the president, said the mayor's death would "unite us" in the fight against the jihadists. "We extend our condolences to the family and friends of the Mogadishu mayor, Abdirahman Omar Osman, and we share our grief regarding this painful death with the entire Somali public," he said in a statement. The mayor and several others badly injured in the suicide attack by Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda-linked militant outfit, were airlifted to Qatar for treatment. The bombing occurred just hours after UN Special Representative for Somalia James Swan had been visiting the mayor. Al-Shabaab were chased out of Mogadishu in 2011 but the capital is still hit regularly by the militants who have fought for more than a decade to topple the Western-backed Somali government. Just days before the assault on the mayor's office a car bomb detonated at a checkpoint near Somalia's international airport, killing 17 people and wounding more than two dozen others.
