JOHANNESBURG Algerian Adel Amrouche was appointed coach of Botswana Tuesday on a three-year contract, and tasked with lifting the fortunes of the African football minnows. Botswana took only one point from a possible 18 in the last Africa Cup of Nations qualifying competition, which led to coach David Bright being fired. Known as the Zebras, Botswana were ranked 42nd in Africa and 147th in the world in the latest Fifa listings. Amrouche, 51, has little time to prepare for his first assignment -- a two-leg 2022 World Cup qualifier against Malawi between September 2 and 10. In November, Botswana visit neighbours Zimbabwe and host defending champions Algeria in 2021 Cup of Nations qualifying matches. This will be the fifth national coach posting for Amrouche after Equatorial Guinea, Burundi, Kenya and Libya.
