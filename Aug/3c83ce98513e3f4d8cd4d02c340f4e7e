Hillary Barchok has been sworn in as the third governor of Bomet in a function witnessed by Deputy President William Ruto. His assumption of office follows the death of Joyce Laboso who was buried last week after she succumbed to cancer on July 29. Kericho High Court Judge George Dullu presided over the swearing-in ceremony assisted by Bomet Senior Principal Magistrate Ms Pamela Akinyi. Dr Barchok raised the Bible and swore allegiance to the Constitution of Kenya and the Leadership Integrity Code at 10:36am in the short ceremony at Bomet Green Stadium. He was thereafter handed the instruments of powers. CHEER Song and dance broke out as residents cheered him on soon after he took the oath of office. Dr Barchok, a former university lecturer at Chuka university, was thrust into politics three years ago when Laboso came looking for him and asked him to be her running mate. He has been the acting Bomet Governor from May 29 through an executive order by Laboso when she left for London to seek medical care. She later went to India and returned to Nairobi Hospital where she passed on. Dr Edwin Abonyo, the husband to the late governor, was among those who attended the swearing-in ceremony alongside Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony and his Narok counterpart Samwell Tunai. Several Members of Parliament from the region were also present.
