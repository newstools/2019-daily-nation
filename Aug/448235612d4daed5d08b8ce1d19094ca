Arsenal have agreed a deal to sell defender Laurent Koscielny to Ligue 1 side Bordeaux for a fee of up to Sh577 million (5m euros). The 33-year-old centre-back is having a medical on Tuesday before completing a return to France after nine years with the Premier League club. Frenchman Koscielny had a year left on his contract at Emirates Stadium and the Gunners wanted him to stay. But he asked for a free transfer and refused to travel on a pre-season tour. Former France international Koscielny rejected a new contract that he felt undervalued his contribution and continued ability. Arsenal began disciplinary proceedings and instructed the captain to train with the under-23s, but offered him a way back into the first-team squad for the new season. However, Koscielny had no intention of reversing his decision and was determined to secure a move to his home country. As well as the medical, personal terms with Bordeaux still need to be finalised. Talks also took place with Bordeaux's Ligue 1 rivals Rennes. Arsenal hope to sign a new centre-back before the Premier League's transfer deadline on Thursday, while they retain an interest in Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney despite the 22-year-old Scotland international being injured. The Gunners are also in advanced talks over the sale of English right-back Carl Jenkinson, 27, to Championship side Nottingham Forest.
