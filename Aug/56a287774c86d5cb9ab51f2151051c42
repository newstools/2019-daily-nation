Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga has dismissed politician Ekuru Aukot's Punguza Mizigo Initiative Bill, saying that it won't solve Kenyans' challenges.

In his remarks on the bill on Thursday evening, however, Mr Odinga said the public is waiting for the report of the Building Bridges Initiative Task Force. "Kenyans are facing many challenges that we know can't be solved through Punguza Mizigo. All we are waiting for is the BBI report so that we can go for a referendum in accordance with our recommendations," he said in Lodwar town, Turkana County. He attended the fifth edition of the Tobung' Lore cultural festival. FAIR ELECTIONS The task force is preparing a report that will be presented to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Odinga.
