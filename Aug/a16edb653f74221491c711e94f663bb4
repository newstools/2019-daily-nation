Paul Bitok has been named head coach of the national women's volleyball team, Malkia Strikers. Bitok, who is back in the country after a 10-year coaching stint in Rwanda, replaces Shaileen Ramdoo who was seconded to Kenya by world volleyball governing body, FIVB, in May. The former Kenyan international will act as the stand-in coach on a short term contract with his first assignment being the African Games to be held in Morocco from August 16 to 31. "How long he (Bitok) remains with the team will depend on how he performs in Morocco," Kenya Volleyball Federation president Waithaka Kioni told Nation Sport. Kenya are the African Games defending champions having won the gong in 2015 in Congo Brazaville with a second-string side led by coach Paul Gitau.
