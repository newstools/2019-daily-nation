A majority of Nyeri ward representatives have opposed the Punguza Mizigo draft bill by Third way Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot even before it is debated saying its proposals are not practical. The Punguza Mizigo bill was presented to the Nyeri County Assembly Wednesday in a mid-morning informal session. But, Speaker John Kaguchia said the bill will be formally debated in October. When Mr Aukot presented the bill in the 46-member assembly, the ward representatives questioned its motive arguing that it was scheme to undermine the National Assembly. Led by Kirimukuyu Ward Representative Muriithi Ndagita, the local leaders said they will not support the bill since it seeks to trim powers of the National Assembly and give veto power to the Senate. "The Senate has been given so much power in this bill and it begs the question, is this bill sponsored by the Senate to undermine the National Assembly? " he asked. Aguthi-Gaaki Ward Representative Stanley Wakibia asked Mr Aukot to come clear on the motive behind the Punguza Mizigo bill. Mr Aukot dismissed the claims saying that the focus of Punguza Mizigo was to help and ensure people at the grass root level get services. He explained that the bill seeks to address concerns of over representation and proposes the reduction of the number of MPs from the current 416 to 147 by abolishing the 290 constituencies, adopting and using each of the 47 counties as a single constituency for purposes of parliamentary election to the Senate and National Assembly. The bill also wants the President’s term changed from the current two five-year terms to a single seven-year term. “Electing one man and one woman to the national assembly and to nominate only six members of parliament from special interest groups. This will also consider gender equality so that there is one man and one woman for each category,” the bill reads.
