A Rwandan brewery apologised Tuesday for printing sexist jokes on its beer labels after its attempt at humour drew a stinging rebuke from some of the country's top female officials. Skol Brewery Limited also promised to immediately discontinue its "Live Laugh Lager" campaign, which saw the offending gags grace the back of its lager bottles and encouraged drinkers to share jokes to win prizes. TWITTER STORM "When can a woman make you a millionaire? When you are a billionaire" read one, alongside a cartoon of a woman surrounded by shopping bags dreaming of a red sports car. Displeasure at the sexist tone of the campaign -- it was promoted by an image of three men laughing over beers -- started on social media but soon high-ranking public officials were joining the fray. "Such language demeaning women is not acceptable in our country, Rwanda. It shouldn't be tolerated... and should be punished by law," said Soline Nyirahabimana, minister of gender and family promotion, on Twitter. Rose Rwabuhihi, who heads Rwanda's Gender Monitoring Office, a public watchdog, said the campaign was "totally unacceptable", comments echoed by one of the country's top crime fighters. "This is not acceptable at all! Skol Rwanda should apologise and remove the product from the market. Otherwise, no woman, no man who supports women should buy or drink such a beer," said Isabelle Kalihangabo, deputy secretary-general of Rwanda Investigation Bureau, the federal crime agency, on Twitter. Rwanda is proud of its record on gender, with women filling some of the country's top positions. It was the first African nation to achieve gender parity in cabinet and more than 60 percent of its MPs are women. The brewer, in a mea culpa issued on Twitter on Tuesday, said it was "very aware" of the backlash and took the matter "very seriously and apologise for any offense caused". "We've stopped production of these jokes," said the brewer.
