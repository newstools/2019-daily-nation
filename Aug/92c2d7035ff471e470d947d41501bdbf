Olunga opened the scoring in the 3rd minute and doubled the lead at the hour mark. Ryoma Ishida pulled one back for the visitors three minutes later, but Brazilian International Cristiano da Silva made it 3-1 in favour of Kashiwa in the 69th minute. Olunga completed his treble with a well taken goal in stoppage time. Olunga took to social media to celebrate the achievement; “Thank you God, all glory is yours. The fans were amazing, thank you for the support.” He posted on Instagram. Kashiwa is at the top of the table with 55 points from 27 matches.
