A judge has allowed Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa to challenge a decision by the secretary of the Firearms Licensing Board not to renew his firearm certificate. Mr Barasa, who filed the case on Friday under certificate of urgency, said that through an oral order of April 25, 2019, the secretary neglected, refused or failed to renew his certificate. Through his lawyer Dunstan Omari, he further noted that the Glock 19 Gen4 9-millimeter firearm he was issued was confiscated. DANGER While noting that the actions put Mr Barasa's life in danger, Mr Omari said he had been threatened by unknown people. He added that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations ascertained the death threats as viable and active. Mr Omari noted that his client was a victim of a robbery with violence along Mombasa Road in January 2019 and that he would not have survived had he not been armed. SECURITY Mr Barasa also sought an order prohibiting Interior CS Fred Matiangâ€™i from recalling the two police officers attached to him, pending determination of the case. The MP said he was apprehensive that the CS would either withdraw or cause the withdrawal of his security. He further said he had not been given reasons for the withdrawal, in writing or any other form, a move he termed unconstitutional. Mr Omari added that "the applicant has been vetted and cleared multiple times and has never been, nor is he currently accused of any violations in use of the firearm". The MP has named the secretary, the board, the Attorney-General and the CS Interior as respondents in the case.   Matiang'i disbanded licensing board, accusing members of corruption.
