For well over a year now, Nairobi City County has been operating without a substantive office. However, Governor Mike Sonko does not seem bothered about the fact that he has not had a deputy for all that time, most likely because that situation suits him. He has dilly-dallied about nominating someone to replace business technocrat Polycarp Igathe, who quit 15 months ago. Several months ago, Mr Sonko indicated that he was about to pick someone. Now, he doesnâ€™t seem to be in a hurry to do so. Indeed, the governor is merely playing games over the matter. Worse, he has been gloating over it and has even had the cheek to tell the Senate Devolution Committee that the appointment of his deputy is a non-issue. Nothing could be further from the truth. NECESSITY The office of the deputy governor is a constitutional position, whose holder is a principal assistant to the governor, having been the running mate in the election. Leaving the position vacant for so long makes a mockery of a set-up that was meant to have two holders at the helm of the county, who complement each other in carrying out their duties. However, as some observers have pointed out, the fact that this most important county, which is the national capital, has been without a deputy for so long without the absence being felt is perhaps a pointer to the fact that such an office is unnecessary. This then is an issue that should be addressed in the constitutional referendum that has been mooted. But this is not a matter than can be left to the whim of one individual, Governor Sonko. He must initiate the process to pick his deputy and fill the vacancy in line with the current dispensation.
