Three officials of the Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) have been in charged with disrupting the ongoing training of tutors on the new curriculum. The trio denied the charges and were freed on Sh20,000 cash bail each or Sh100,000 bond by a Makindu court. Kibwezi Sub County Police Commader Ben Changulo said the suspects, who were arrested on Tuesday, led a team of junior Knut officials to the Isunguluni Primary School where they disrupted the training. The charged suspects are: Mr Gabriek Kisilu (Kibwezi branch secretary), Ms Miriam Mwania (treasurer), and Mr Henry Kivuva. Several others who were with them escaped. On Tuesday, the new Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai warned of tough action against any people found disrupting the ongoing training. Knut boss Wilson Sossion, who is opposed to the implementation of the new competency based curriculum, had urged teachers to boycott the training. But many teachers across the country ignored his call and turned out for the four-day training.   Kibwezi officials Gabriel Kisilu and Mirriam Mwania will be charged on Wednesday.
