City lawyer Assa Nyakundi will spend Thursday night at the Muthaiga Police Station to allow detectives complete processing him before they can officially charge him. Mr Nyakundi was arraigned at the Makadara Law Courts Thursday afternoon, with his family in attendance. He is accused of shooting and killing his son over six weeks ago. His five-man legal team, led by Mr Ken Nyaundi agreed with the prosecution to have him detained for one day to enable them complete their processes before they can officially charge him. According to Directorate of Criminal Investigations officer Oliver Nabonwe, the possible charges to be preferred against Mr Nyakundi are murder or manslaughter. Mr Nyaundi did not oppose the application by the prosecution but requested that Mr Nyakundi spends only one night in police custody and is supplied with his medication. "The respondent needs to be under extensive insulin treatment. His blood pressure levels shot up today when he was told he would be appearing before court," the lawyer said. He added that his client was also suffering from depression and fluctuating blood sugar levels. Mr Nyaundi's application for bail was however rejected as chief magistrate H M Nyaga said it would be premature to set bail terms and would wait until Mr Nyakundi was formally charged. The case will be mentioned Friday at midday.   The lawyer missed his son's burial on April 3.
