Shocking images of the horrendous destruction by the new cyclone wreaking havoc in southern Africa, and the earlier one, call for heightened alert and preparedness. True, these natural calamities, including floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and other deadly geological processes, are unstoppable but it does not mean that the victims should just throw their hands up in the air and wait to be swamped. The first one, Cyclone Idai, flattened 90 per cent of the Mozambican port city of Beira, claiming 1,000 lives, and also left a trail of destruction in other towns and rural areas in other southern African countries. The current one, Cyclone Kenneth, has unleashed floods and heavy winds, causing massive damage on the eastern coast of Africa. The cost of the devastation, the weather experts are warning, could run into billions of shillings. The media pictures coming out of Mtwara in southern Tanzania, where homes have been swept away, with the people seeking refuge on safer ground, speak volumes about the serious need to take precautions. Thankfully, the experts have clarified, Kenya is not directly in the path of Cyclone Kenneth, but Mombasa Island and other coastal areas won't entirely escape the after-effects, especially the expected heavy rains and flooding. Tanzania has ordered the closure of schools and businesses in Mtwara region to protect lives. Kenyan authorities had better take contingency plans as well. We cannot emphasise enough the need to create public awareness and enhance preparedness to mitigate the damage of cyclones and other natural tragedies. Our weather experts have in recent times immensely improved their accuracy in weather forecasts. Despite their assurance that there is nothing to worry about as Cyclone Kenneth hurtles through Tanzania and Mozambique, there is a need to prepare the people for any eventuality. This is the only way to avert a human catastrophe that United Nations officials have also cautioned about.
