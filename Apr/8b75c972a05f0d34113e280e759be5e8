Inspector General of Police (IGP) Hillary Mutyambai has said National Police Service is arranging for counselling sessions for three-time World 1,500 metres champion Asbel Kiprop following a series of disturbing posts on social media. Mutyambai told Nation Sport that Kiprop presented himself at Kapseret Police Station when he learnt that officers had been dispatched to disarm him. "After a series of posts on the social media, a team from the NPS started looking for the athlete and by good luck he presented himself at Kapseret Police Station. He will undergo some counselling after a series of disturbing posts earlier in the day," said Mutyambai. Earlier in the day in a sensational tweet Kiprop, 29, dared his National Police Service employers to sack him and withdraw his firearm before he uses it to “earn justice.” The constable also dared the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the world athletics governing body, to take all the medals he won in global competitions. “I pray to National Police Service to dismiss me now. Before I use their machinery to earn myself justice. Kindly. IAAF come take your medals. I don’t need any on my house wall,” he tweeted at 3.23pm on Saturday. At 10.58pm on Friday, the obviously disturbed athlete had sent another tweet saying: “They can’t stand me now & for me to earn justice but if I die today, They will attend my send off to testify my legacy & preach my legacy!! Don’t welcome them.” Efforts by Nation Sport to reach Kiprop proved futile after our calls went unanswered and he failed to respond to our texts.   In a sensational tweet Kiprop, 29, dared his National Police Service employers to sack him.
