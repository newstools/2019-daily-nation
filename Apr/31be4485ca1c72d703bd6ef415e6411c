Naftali Kinuthia, the man accused of killing Moi University medical trainee Ivy Wangechi, has been charged with murder. Mr Kinuthia was charged on Tuesday morning at the High Court before Justice Stanley Githinji in Eldoret. He was accused of planning and executing the gruesome murder on April 9 outside the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. He denied the charge and applied to be released on bond. “The accused person is not a flight risk and he is a Kenyan of sound mind. He is ready to appear before this court whenever required and there is no justifiable reason to deny him bail,” argued his lawyer Mbiyu Kamau. The prosecution led by Rosemary Karanja opposed the appeal. Justice Githinji directed that Mr Kinuthia be detained until May 9 when his bond application will be heard. The hearing was set for June 10. The late Ms Wangechi was laid to rest on April 18 at their ancestral home in Mahiga, Nyeri County.
