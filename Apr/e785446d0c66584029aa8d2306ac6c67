Eight people have been killed in separate road crashes. In Narok County, four people were killed and six others injured after a 14-seater matatu they were travelling in collided with a Toyota Prado in Katakala on the Narok-Bomet road.

Meanwhile, six members of a Nairobi church died when a van they were traveling in to a dowry ceremony in Kitui rolled in Ikutha Town on Kibwezi-Kitui road. Four people died on the spot and two others died while receiving treatment at Ikutha Sub-county Hospital.   "We received 11 patients at the facility. Two have succumbed to injuries sustained in the accident and we are working on referring two patients who are in a critical condition to Kitui County Referral Hospital," medical superintendent Dr Paul Kibati said. The 14-seater van owned by a Nairobi car hire service, was part of an entourage of several hired vehicles that left Nairobi at 3am on Sunday for the ceremony at Kwa Mbaki village.

The vehicle was speeding and it rolled three times and we lost our senior pastor, and other members," Mr Martin Mbuthia told Nation at Ikutha hospital where he was treated and discharged. Police officers at the scene said that the driver of the van lost control of the vehicle after one of its rare tires bust.
