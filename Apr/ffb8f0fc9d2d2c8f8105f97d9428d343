Teachers in Homa Bay County have thrown their weight behind their union’s Secretary-General Wilson Sossion in rejecting training on the new competency-based curriculum (CBC). The teachers have rejected the training from the Ministry of Education which is meant to enable them teach learners effectively and enable them master skills at their own pace regardless of the environment they are in. According to the ministry, the CBC is expected to give learners the most effective education. But teachers have rejected it, claiming they have not been adequately prepared for it. Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) officials from Homa Bay have opposed the CBC training, arguing that most schools do not have the capacity needed to manage the new curriculum. NO MATERIALS Knut Homa Bay Branch Executive Secretary Cornel Ojuok said most schools in his area do not have learning materials necessary to enable the smooth rollout of the programme. “Most learning institutions do not have enough teachers to enable the implementation of this programme. The government must first recruit educators before the programme commences,” he said. NO CONSULTATIONS Mr Ojuok accused the Ministry of Education of introducing new policies without consulting teachers. He asked his members not to attend the training which is set to start next week. “The ministry expects teachers to attend the training without providing facilitation fees. Mr Sossion had also told teachers across the county not to attend the training.   Secretary-General Wilson Sossion gives reasons why teachers should boycott the exercise.
