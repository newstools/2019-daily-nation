FKE Executive Director Jacqueline Mugo on Tuesday urged employers not to implement the policy as directed by the Housing ministry and the Kenya Revenue Authority. “The notice by the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing, Urban Development and Public Works in conjunction with Kenya Revenue Authority has issued a go-head on the implementation of the Housing Fund Levy with effect from May 9, 2019. This is contrary to the court orders which are still in force,” said Ms Mugo in a statement. Ms Mugo said FKE attended court on April 8, 2019, and obtained an order suspending the implementation of the levy until May 20, when the case will be mentioned. “The Gazette notice is therefore unlawful and we shall keep you posted on any further developments,” said the FKE boss.
