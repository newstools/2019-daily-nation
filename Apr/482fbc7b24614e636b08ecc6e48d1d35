Police in Murang’a have arrested a woman over her husband’s death. The 47-year-old woman allegedly hacked her husband using a panga, set his body on fire and attempted to bury his remains outside their home in Good Samaritan village, Gatanga early Saturday morning after a domestic dispute. Murang’a County police boss Josphat Kinyua said three of the woman’s children are suspected have had a hand in the murder. Mr Kinyua said the woman and the three teenage girls are in police custody. James Ndirangu, a brother of the victim, told the Nation that he was attracted to the homestead by huge flames only to find the suspect digging a hole using a jembe and a spade. “I had just woken up when I saw huge flames at my brother’s home. I approached and found his wife digging a hole and she told me she was burning old rugs. “I was not satisfied with the answer and pretended to go back to my house. I looked back and saw her dragging a body,” he said. Mr Ndirangu made a distress call and neighbours arrived at the home. They discovered the partly burnt body of his brother. The police boss said officials have opened investigation into the incident.
