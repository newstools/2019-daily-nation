Two people are feared dead after they slipped and fell into the Menengai Crater in Nakuru County Saturday. The two, according to police, had travelled from Kitale in Trans Nzoia County for Easter weekend prayers. They are said to have attended a church service at nearby Presbyterian Church of East Africa in Kirima near the crater. However, their mission to enjoy the scenic view turned tragic after they fell into the crater. Sources at the church told the Nation that the two men had told the congregation at the church that they were in Nakuru for Easter prayers. Passers by said they heard the men calling for help on Sunday morning. According to the Menengai Forest Community chairman Paul Waweru, one body was found Sunday evening. “Various teams from the Kenya Red Cross Society and the Nakuru County government fire brigade are leading the search," said Mr Waweru. "The Kenya Red Cross team discovered one of the bodies in the crater on Sunday evening but they could not retrieve his body due to the steep nature of the crater." Bahati Police Commander Jacinta Muthoni said police had joined the rescue team. “I urge those visiting the crater to be cautious to avoid similar incidents," said the police boss. Residents now want the Nakuru County government to fence the area to avoid such incidents which they say are frequent.
