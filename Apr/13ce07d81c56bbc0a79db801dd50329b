MILAN Juventus claimed their eighth consecutive Serie A title on Saturday with a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Fiorentina. Alex Sandro's diving header after 37 minutes and an own goal from Fiorentina defender German Pezzella after a Cristiano Ronaldo cross on 53 minutes sealed a 35th Scudetto. Serbian defender Nikola Milenkovic had put Fiorentina ahead after six minutes. Juventus are 20 points clear of nearest rivals Napoli with just five games to play.
