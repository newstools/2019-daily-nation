Popular social network sites Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have been hit by outage worldwide. Users took to Twitter to raise concerns over their inability to access the Mark Zuckerberg-owned sites and apps shortly after 2pm on Sunday. Many of the users said they could not login or send messages. Mr Zuckerberg has not yet issued a statement to inform the sites and apps users, who run into hundreds of millions, why their systems are offline. According to ‘Down For Everyone Or Just Me’, a website which helps online users check whether a certain website is down or not, both Facebook.com and Instagram.com registered downtimes while messages on WhatsApp could not go through. Down detector.com, another site which allows online users to report outages, also registered spikes in global outage. Facebook was hit by a similar outage back in March 14, 2019.
