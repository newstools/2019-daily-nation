Kenya Commercial Bank became the third team to qualify for this year's SportPesa Shield semis after edging out National Super League side Bidco United 4-1 in a quarterfinal match at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos on Sunday. KCB will meet the winner of the clash between defending champions Kariobangi Sharks and Bungoma SuperStars Bolton Omwenga broke the deadlock in the sixth minute through a free kick after Lambert Oyugi had fouled Kennedy Owino on the right side. Bidco custodian Frankline Mwenda was at fault for poorly timing the ball. Four minutes later, Kennedy Owino doubled the lead with a sumptuous left foot volley after a nice interplay with his teammates inside the area that left Bidco defence napping. Dinken Mwema turned home a delightful free kick from 25 yards for Bidco's consolation at the hour mark, before Victor Omondi, who rested Martin Nderitu on 71 minutes, slotted home KCB's third goal. Captain Mike Kibwage smashed home the fourth with a header off a Bolton Omwenga corner kick on 84 minutes. Bidco had the first chance on 16 minutes when Emmanuel Onyancha forced KCB goalkeeper Peter Manyika to a finger tip save with a looping header. On 24 minutes, Dinken Mwema's free kick outside 18 was parried out by Manyika for a fruitless corner as the Thika-based side failed to make use of their corners in the opening stanza. The bankers were forced to an early change on 35 minutes after Rwandese defender Gabriel Mugabo limped off with a knock, Baraka Badi replaced him.
