Police in Vihiga County Thursday arrested a man for allegedly killing his friend over Sh60 debt. Emmukunzi Assistant Chief Wilson Matika said the 39-year-old victim was hit by a blunt object. Mr Matika said the victim was demanding a payment of Sh60 owed to him by the suspect when he was attacked. The victim had prepared a bundle of firewood for sale and the suspect received proceeds of the sale on his behalf. Mr Matika said the suspect was unhappy after his friend requested to be given his money, leading to the attack. The weapon used was recovered by the police. The assistant chief said the suspect will be charged with murder after the Easter holiday.
