The Meru County government has partnered with the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) to rehabilitate alcoholics. Meru liquor board chief executive Mwaki Arimi said they have identified four rehabilitation centres in the county with NHIF set to foot part of the rehabilitation cost. Speaking at Mujwa Catholic Church on Sunday, the official said the number of alcoholics in the county has increased fuelled by mushrooming of unlicensed bars. “Those people ‘must take something when they wake up saying they are removing lock are sick and need to be cured. We are identifying such people for treatment,” said Mr Arimi. Mr Arimi said those interested in undertaking the treatment should first visit Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital for diagnosis. The official said they are working with newly-create market committees to regulate the number of bars to minimise access and curb alcoholism. “We are doing a census on the number of bars to ensure we regulate their operation. We also want to weed out those operating illegally,” he said.
