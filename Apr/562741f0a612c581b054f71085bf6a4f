Good Samaritans helped pull out the passengers from matatu wreck. The driver of the car they hit also escaped unhurt. The accident occurred amid heavy rains pounded the area. “I urge motorists to take extreme caution on the roads as parts of the country experience downpours.Road safety is the responsibility of all Kenyans and therefore we should be vigilant and ensure we fasten seat belts always,”said Mr Charles Njogu, the assistant corporate communications director at Kenya National Highways Authorit.
