A self-proclaimed ally of Deputy President William Ruto in Makueni County was on Tuesday charged with giving false information to a primary school head teacher. Ms Jane Nduku Makau is accused of informing Mr Philip Musyoki Kiema, the head teacher of Unoa Primary School, that DP Ruto was set to preside over a fundraiser at the school on April 7, information she knew was false. Mr Musyoki is said to have lined up pupils to entertain guests only to realise later in the evening that there was no such function planned at the school. The suspect denied the charge of giving false information when she was arraigned before Resident Magistrate Joan Otieno at the Makueni Law Courts on Monday. She was remanded after failing to raise the bond of Sh 50,000 or the Sh 30,000 cash bail to secure her freedom. The case will be heard on May 8.
