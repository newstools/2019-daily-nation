The Children’s Court in Mombasa has ordered former Lamu West MP Julius Ndegwa to clear rent arrears of Sh140,000 to avert eviction from their residence in Nyali The orders were issued after Rehema Susan Maalim, who claims to be Mr Ndegwa’s wife, told the court that the former lawmaker had abandoned her for five months. Tononoka Children’s Court ordered the Mr Ndegwa to settle the debt to avoid the eviction of the woman whom they have a child with. “Pending the hearing and determination of this application, the respondent is hereby compelled to clear the rent arrears as required by the landlord of the premise where the applicant and her child reside,” Senior Resident Magistrate Lucy Sindani said. The woman told the court that Mr Ndegwa had failed to pay rent for five months and that auctioneers had threatened to evict her and sell her property. Ms Maalim pleaded for quick intervention saying she and her daughter stand to be rendered destitute should the court fail to compel the respondent to clear the debt. She said that she met Mr Ndegwa in 2014 in Lamu where their love blossomed resulting into the birth of her child. “The respondent and I initially were residents of Lamu where we met but sometimes in 2017, I relocated to Mombasa where I opened a business,” she said. Mr Ndegwa has not filed a response to the allegations. The case will be heard on May 20.
