Barely a month after being crowned the best teacher in the world, Brother Peter Tabichi has been appointed champion for children in conflicts and crisis by a global body, Varky Foundation. Bro Tabichi will now champion the cause of the 75 million children worldwide, whose education is disrupted by conflicts and natural disasters. In a statement, the foundation said they’re banking on the inspiring story and powerful voice of the Maths and Physics teacher — a Catholic Franciscan monk at Keriko Secondary School in Nakuru — to raise the urgency on the world stage to invest in the future of children in crisis. Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the UN Special Envoy for Global Education, and Chairperson of Education Cannot Wait’s High-Level Steering Group, called Bro Tabichi an “inspiration”. Bro Tabichi said it’s an honour to serve children whose lives have been blighted by war and catastrophe. The 36-year-old is a member of the Franciscan Brothers, an order in the Catholic Church. The mathematics and physics teacher at Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in Pwani village, Nakuru County made Kenya and Africa shine when he bagged the $1 million (Sh100 million) prize, beating nine other contenders. The panel praised him for donating 80 per cent of his salary to help needy students as well as families in Pwani village, and his ability to make learners love science. Colleagues say his dedication, passion to teaching and his humility are unrivalled. “Bro Tabichi’s belief in his students has made our poorly equipped school perform well in national science competitions,” Mr Benjamin Buluku, a mathematics and chemistry teacher said. “He revamped the science club and became our role model.”   Peter Tabichi, a mathematics and science at Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School, wins Sh100m prize.
