Police arrested two women in Mombasa County on Tuesday after finding them with a kilogram of heroin worth Sh3 million. Salima Bakari Ali, 62, and 40-year-old Zainab Abdi Farah were also found with Sh98,500 cash, believed to be proceeds of their illegal business. Nyali Sub-county Police Commander Simon Thirikwa said the two were arrested after a raid by anti-narcotics officers from Nairobi. “We nabbed them at their house in Nyali. We are holding them at Nyali Police Station. They will be taken to court on Thursday,” said Mr Thirikwa. The arrests came two weeks after two suspected drug traffickers were apprehended with three kilograms of heroin worth millions of shillings. The two were arrested in Nyali and Kisauni constituencies following an intelligence report, according to police. They were apprehended by officers from the Anti-Narcotics Unit, who had been trailing them.   Substance abuse negatively affects academic growth of users.
