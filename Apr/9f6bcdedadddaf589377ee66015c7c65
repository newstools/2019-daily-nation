A couple and their two sons, who were burnt to death in their house at the weekend, were on Friday buried in the same grave at their Murimanjo village home in Kathera, Meru county. The victims were Mr Eric Guantai (41), his wife Caroline Gakii (36), Tony Mwenda (12) and Christian Karani (six). Family members, residents and church leaders eulogised them as a model family that thrived in church, community and business affairs. WHAT HAPPENED The family died in a fire that broke out at about 3.30am on Sunday. Mr Robert Mwirigi, Mr Guantai's cousin, narrated how they were woken up by screams but were unable to put out the fire as it was raging. “We tried to put it out using water but it was too fierce and was being fuelled by wind," he said. It took about 20 minutes for the house to be razed to the ground. Rescuers found the bodies huddled together in the parents’ bedroom, in what appeared to have been their attempt to protect the children. Two vehicles were partially burnt in the incident. INCONSOLABLE At the funeral, mourners were inconsolable as the four bodies were lowered into the grave, a few metres from where the family's timber house once stood. The caskets bearing the remains of the children were placed between those of the parents. Led by Meru Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu, leaders demanded answers from Kenya Power on the cause of the fire. “We are talking to Kenya Power since fire disasters are frequent. We are also talking to the county commissioner so the investigations are speedy," Mr Ntuchiu said during a service at Taai Methodist Church near Kagwampungu market. "We don’t want the investigations delayed. We would like to establish if the fire was caused by an electric fault." His sentiments were echoed by County Chief of Staff Gideon Kimathi and a host of members of county assembly. Nkuene MCA Martin Koome Makasi said fire engines should be available in towns and markets.   Residents in Meru village say they were unable to put out the fire.
