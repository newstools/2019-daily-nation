Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has denied a report that his government is destroying Kwa Itinga Dam in Mwala Sub-county to build a stadium. This followed concerns by a section of Machakos residents that Dr Mutua's administration was determined to destroy the dam after earth movers working around the dam recently. "This dam constructed in 1960s is getting destroyed to pave way for a stadium," a resident, Dr Shadrack Mule, tweeted on Sunday, drawing the attention of the National Environmental Management Authority to the ongoing works, and triggering a flurry of reactions. The dam, which is located near Masii township along Machakos-Kitui road, is the main source of water for hundreds of area residents and their livestock all year round. Dr Mutua dismissed those behind the dam's destruction claims as enemies of development.
