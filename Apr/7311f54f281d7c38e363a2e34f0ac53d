A family has been left stranded at a mortuary in Machakos after failing to trace the body of their 87-year-old father which they had gone to collect for burial. The burial of Samuel Mulei Kioko, which was to take place in Masii on Wednesday, was postponed indefinitely after the family discovered that his body had been removed from Montezuma Funeral Home in Machakos last Friday and buried in Kasunguni village, Makueni County. Officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations went to the funeral home and questioned the management. "We are now stranded because we have been told that the body which we had come to pick was taken and buried by other people. We do not know what to do," said Mr Joseph Muindi, the secretary of the funeral organising committee. He said they had spent two weeks organising for the funeral of Mzee Mulei and could not understand how such a mistake could happen. "I woke up at 5am to come and pick the body but the director of the funeral home has told us the body was picked on Friday and buried in Kasunguni. He has gone there and we are still waiting for a report," said Mr Stephen Kilai, a member of the funeral committee. Some family members had flown from the US and India for the burial.
