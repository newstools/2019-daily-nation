General Service Unit (GSU) and Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) seem to have recovered from that disappointing show on the continental front last month to dominate at the men and women's competition's of the 2019 Kenya Volleyball Federation Tournament staged at Kitui High School over the weekend. Despite the triumph, it wasn't all plain sailing for the two clubs. KCB, for example, had to mastermind a come from behind 3-2(25-21,23-25,17-25,25-17,15-12) victory over league champions Kenya Prisons. "It was a hard fought contest," said KCB coach Japheth Munala. "We have lost to them on two occasions in the recent past and there was a need to change in our strategy especially in attacks and blocks." The Bankers posted the best possible start in set one, setter Joan Muindi proving key in laying off the attacks to Leonida Kasaya and Noel Murambi. On their part, new signing Loreen Chebet and Violet Makuto stemmed the flow of attacks from the opposition with precise blocks. Meanwhile, GSU defeated Equity Bank in straight sets of 25-16,26-24,25-14 to lift the men's title. GSU and KCB had struggled at the Africa Club Championship held in Cairo in March with both clubs failing to make it past the quarters. Ilika High School triumphed in the schools' category while Huruma Queens won the self-supporting teams' competition.
