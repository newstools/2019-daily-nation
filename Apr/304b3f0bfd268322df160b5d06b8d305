Police in Mombasa on Thursday arrested six people in connection to the theft of mobile phones, laptops and other electronics for resale. County Police Commander Johnston Ipara said the items were recovered and the suspects apprehended in an operation that covered Kisauni and Mwembe Tayari. “In Kisauni, two persons were arrested and [found with] two 42- and 52- inch flat screen televisions,” Mr Ipara told the Nation. At Raha Leo building in Mwembe Tayari, he said, four people were arrested and 43 mobile phones, 22 laptops, 10 computer monitors, two woofers, two DStv decoders, two projectors and 29 rolls of bhang found. Mr Ipara said one of the suspects was arrested while in the process of selling four phones and that one of those found in Kisauni was believed to be a "prime mover". “This shows persons who purport to be shylocks and repairers of old mobile phones are receivers of what we believe are stolen gadgets," he said.     WARNING Mr Ipara said they were alerted by a resident who said his phones were stolen from his house. As such, he warned landlords and businessmen engaged in the crime, saying they would be arrested and prosecuted. “Every person running a building used by persons we believe are receivers of stolen goods will also be taken to court. It will not be business as usual,” he said. While noting that the police service is made up dedicated and hardworking officers who mean well for the people, he appealed to residents for cooperation. The commander further asked the people to go to Central Police Station to identify the goods. “Come forward without fear. We will ensure we end these crimes,” he said. Regarding the Easter holiday, he told residents that police had made elaborate plans to keep them safe.     The suspects rebrand and repackage stolen laptops and sell them as new gadgets.
