Visiting Wazito FC on Sunday thrashed host Kisumu All Stars 4-0 in a National Super League match at Moi stadium in Kisumu. Three first-half goals from Musa Masika and Paul Acqua and a late one from Teddy Osok affirmed Wazito's promotion chase and handed the 'Blue Eagles' their first season's home loss. Before this encounter, Wazito were ahead of All-Stars by one point only, a scenario which set up an evenly poised tie as both sides fight for a place in next season top flight league. The hosts threatened on the fifth minute through a well-taken free-kick by Shadrack Omondi, which Wazito's goalkeeper Steve Njunge gathered to safety, before Masika fired coach Fred Ambani's side ahead a minute later. The latter won the ball near All-Stars' danger area and turned well to send a rising left-footed shot past goalkeeper John Owuoth. Two minutes later, Acqua capitalised on a melee at All-Stars goal mouth to stretched his side's lead with an easy finish. The Kisumu-based side attempted to reduce the deficit from a number of opportunities, but they were denied by Wazito's steel defence. Masika killed the game for the Nairobi-based side at the stroke of halftime after connecting to a cross from the left-wing. In the second-half, both sides made early substitutions, All-Stars introducing Ian Motanda for Gerishon Arabe, while Wazito brought in Victor Ndinya for Acqua. Omondi blasted wide a 56th minute All-Star opportunity, before they saw a penalty appeal four minutes later denied by the referee. While coach Francis Oduor's side dictated the second half, they suffered a blow on the 80th minute when unmarked Osok slotted home from inside the box, to seal his side's huge victory.
