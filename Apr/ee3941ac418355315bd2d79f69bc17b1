Investors and Kenyans of goodwill have been urged to always remember the poor from their home areas and help them uplift their lives by assisting them. They have also been urged to comfort the less fortunate in society by showing them love when they face tribulations in life. The call was made by Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria’s wife, Jane Mwangi, who said that remembering the poor and the less fortunate is living the way Jesus Christ wanted and the best way to celebrate Easter. Mrs Mwangi, who Friday joined Murang’a County Assembly members and musicians from Mt Kenya region in donating food and clothes to over 10 children’s homes in the county, spoke in Kenol town when she flagged off the delivery of the donations. BASIC NEEDS "The biblical teaching that Christ died for our sins is enough challenge for investors and those who have been blessed to remember the poor and always provide them with basic needs,” she said. Mrs Mwangi said she decided to partner with musicians so that, apart from celebrating Easter together with the orphans, the celebrated musicians would also get a chance to entertain their fans who hardly get a chance to meet them face to face.   "We want to celebrate the holidays with the orphans as we remind them that Christ died because of us and there are enough reasons to be happy and be thankful to Him despite the circumstances we face in life. ENTERTAIN "Musicians will entertain the children as we interact with them using biblical stories," she said. On his part, musician John De Mathew said their association, Tamco Sacco, will continue partnering with the county government in changing the lives of the vulnerable within the community. "The county government assisted us when forming the sacco and we will continue partnering with them in their development and social activities," he said. He also urged governors from other counties to also partner with musicians.
