Kenya's Brigid Kosgei claimed the biggest victory of her career when she stunned a rich field to win women’s London Marathon on Sunday. The 25-year-old Kosgei, who won Chicago Marathon six months ago, pulled away from defending champion Vivian Cheruiyot after cruising past the 35km mark to win in 2 hours, 18 minutes and 20 seconds and become the youngest female London winner, Kosgei and Cheruiyot broke away from just after the 25km to engage in a thrilling exchange of leads as they passed 30km in 1:39:45 with Kosgei leading by two seconds. Then Kosgei gradually started to pull away clocking 35km mark in 1:55:48 with Cheruiyot three seconds behind. Kosgei never locked back to build her lead passing the 40km mark in 2:11:19 to win and exact revenge on Cheruiyot, who beat her last year. Pocket Rocket came second in 2:20:14 with Ethiopia’s Roza Dereje completing the podium finish in 2:20:51. Cheruiyot was initially able to stay with her when Kosgei made a break at the 20-mile mark, but could not maintain the pace and drifted away some four miles from the finish. According to statistics compiled by the BBC, Kosgei ran the second half of the race in a time of 66 minutes and 42 seconds -- the fastest for the women's event. Kosgei is 25 days younger than Aselefech Mergia when she won the 2010 race. "I gave it my best today, 2nd in the London Marathon. Congratulations Bridget Kosgei and Eliud Kipchoge," tweeted Cheruiyot. Top 10 Women's results 1. Brigid Kosgei (KEN) 2:18:20, 2. Vivian Cheruiyot (KEN) 2:20:14, 3. Roza Dereje (ETH) 2:20:51, 4.
