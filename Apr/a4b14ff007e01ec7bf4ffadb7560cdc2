Kariobangi Sharks coach William Muluya fondly known as Kanu is confident the team will get back to winning ways after an eight-match winless run. Sharks had super sub George Abege to thank for striking late to cancel out Whyvonne Isuza’s 27th second opener in their 1-1 draw against AFC Leopards at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Wednesday. Sharks, who enjoying their third season in the top flight, last won on March 13, a 1-0 win over Nzoia Sugar, but have since posted four draws and similar defeats in their past eight matches. “Good things are in the offing,” said Muluya, whose team has amassed 33 points from 25 rounds, sitting ninth in the 18-team SportPesa Premier League table. He added: “I have a strong belief with how we’ve been playing, a bit relaxed with no tension, I am sure we are going to win soon, maybe we might win the coming nine matches. "Every game we are trying to bring in new faces because of the condensed matches with a lean squad.” He hailed Abege, who replaced Sydney Lokale on 78 minutes, for his late equaliser that aroused a stylish celebration from the team. “Sometimes I say bench players are the most important when they come on, he had a few minutes and with a goal, I am pleased,” Muluya said of the former Bandari and Sony Sugar man. “It was a good performance from the entire team considering we were one man less and they scored early on.” Sharks host Posta Rangers on Saturday, before visiting Chemelil Sugar Wednesday next week.   Ingwe's 12th draw this term stretches their unbeaten run to seven games
