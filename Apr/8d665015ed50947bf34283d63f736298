Athletes participating in Sunday’s Eldoret City Marathon are expected to face harsh climate conditions according to the race organisers of the second edition. Race director and two-time Boston Marathon champion Moses Tanui said that the athletes will have a tough time because of the current hot conditions being experienced across the country. “The weather this year is not conducive and might even affect the results since the athletes will be competing in hot conditions. Many will be affected but we have put medical practitioners on standby,” said Tanui. Major roads in Eldoret town will be closed at 5am with members of public urged to walk to their various destinations in the Central Business District where the action will be taking place. Uasin Gishu Deputy County Commander Zachaeus Ng’eno urged the public to co-operate with police officers to make the event successful. “The roads will be closed early in the morning and I want to urge the members of public to obey the rules and follow instructions from the officers,” said Ng'eno. Security has also been beefed up in the area given that Kenyans are celebrating Easter holidays at the moment. The race has attracted a number of elite athletes including former London Marathon champion Emmanuel Mutai, 2017 Daegu Marathon champion Mathew Kisorio, Beijing Marathon champion Valary Aiyabei among others. “I have trained well for the task ahead where I want to be in the podium but I know it will be competitive because Kenyans are very good especially in the road races,” said Kisorio, who trains in Kapsabet, Nandi County. The winners will go home Sh3.5 million richer with the top 20 athletes being rewarded.   Women will be the first to race from 7am.
