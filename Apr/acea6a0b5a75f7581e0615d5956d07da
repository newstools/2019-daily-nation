Former Great Rift 10-a-side rugby champions Nakuru RFC registered mixed fortunes as the 29th edition of the annual tournament started at Nakuru Athletics Club on Saturday. Nakuru, popularly known as ‘Wanyore’, started their campaign to reclaim the trophy they last won in 2015 by beating rookies Makueni 24-0 in their opening match. But in their second outing, the Felix Oloo-coached side crashed 14-17 at the hands of the swift University of Nairobi Mean Machine. In their final preliminary match, Nakuru drew 5-5 with Menengai Oilers in a sibling rivalry that saw ‘Wanyore’ come from behind to snatch a draw. A well-oiled Mean Machine frustrated "Wanyore" who enjoyed an overwhelming home support from the rugby mad fans. However, in their second match, Mean Machine stalled when they lost 17-0 to Menengai Oilers who launched their title chase in a flying style to send a strong signal of what is expected of them in the tournament that ends today. Oilers won their second match when they buried the inexperienced Makueni 17-7.

Egerton had a consolation when they were awarded a walk over after Kiambu failed to show up for the match.
