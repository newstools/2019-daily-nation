Two people died Monday after a Kiambu-bound matatu lost control and plunged into a valley in Karura Forest near DCI headquarters. A baby died at the scene of the crash and a woman passed on while receiving treatment in hospital, police said. Officials said 10 people are hospitalised at Guru Nanak and Kenyatta hospitals. Six of the victims are said to be in the intensive care unit. Reports indicate the 14-seater matatu was in a group of vehicles that were overlapping when it veered off the road. Photos from the crash scene showed several passengers lying on the ground, helpless. The matatu, belonging to Marafiki Sacco, was reduced to a mangled wreck, with the roof ripped away as vehicle crashed through trees. The crash caused a heavy traffic snarl-up on the busy road as volunteers blocked it with a breakdown that was used to pull the matatu wreckage from the valley. Additional reporting by Leopold Obi
