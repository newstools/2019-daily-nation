AFC Leopards coach Andre Cassa Mbungo has admitted that individual mistakes from his defence cost them two points against 10-man Kariobangi Sharks during their 1-1 draw against AFC Leopards at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Wednesday. Midfielder Whyvonne Isuza had shot Ingwe ahead early on, but substitute George Abege equalised deep into stoppage time. “Had we won, we were to leapfrog Sharks in ninth position on the log, but a lapse in concentration towards the end cost us,” a devastated Mbungo said. “We committed the same mistake against Homeboyz and Vihiga United. We execute a good game plan, but in the end we drop vital points as a result of individual mistakes,” he added. “It was even harder playing against 10-men because they seemed motivated by being less. We need to work even harder, more morale in camp because we are chasing to finish the league in a better position. We’ve come from bottom of the log and it has not been easy but with support, we will wind up the season on a high.” Leopards, who are 10th on 31 points from 24 rounds, are yet to lose in the past seven games. They’ve instead registered four wins and three draws. “It’s sad when we play well but drop points, we still have a long way to go, we will continue to work,” concluded the Rwandese, whose side next faces Bandari on Sunday.   Ingwe's 12th draw this term stretches their unbeaten run to seven games
