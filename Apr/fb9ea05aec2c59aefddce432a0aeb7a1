PARIS Attacking riders at the Tour de France will be further rewarded after an increase in valuable bonus seconds for being the first to crest key summits. The new system was ratified by the international cycling federation (UCI), a source said Thursday. The winner of each bonus-point sprint will now receive eight seconds, the runner-up five seconds and the third-placed finisher two seconds, instead of 3, 2 and 1sec in place last year. Eight bonus-point sprints (host town in brackets): Stage 3 (Epernay): cote de Mutigny Stage 6 (La Planche des Belles Filles): col des Chevreres Stage 8 (Saint-Etienne): cote de la Jailliere Stage 9 (Brioude): cote de Saint-Just Stage 12 (Bagneres-de-Bigorre): Hourquette d'Ancizan Stage 15 (Foix Prat d'Albis): mur de Peguere Stage 18 (Valloire): col du Galibier Stage 19 (Tignes): col de l'Iseran
