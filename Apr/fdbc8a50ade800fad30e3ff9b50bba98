Firefighters in Murang'a were on Monday afternoon trying to put off a fire that broke out at the Barclays Bank branch. Witnesses said there was a foul smell emanating from the bank. Joyce Macharia, who works at a law firm next to the bank, said she saw huge smoke coming from the bank at about 1pm. She and other people who operate near the bank had to move out of their premises for their safety. "I was in the office when we noticed a foul smell and after it persisted, I switched off the electricity and came out of the office. I later learnt that the smoke was coming from the bank," she said. The Barclays Bank branch is situated in Murang'a town next to Amica Savings and Credit Sacco, formerly known as Murata Sacco.   Robbed ATMs were either unmanned or had malfunctioning surveillance cameras.
