The Mombasa County Health department is on high alert following a cholera outbreak at a Nairobi hospital as visitors from Kenya’s capital and other parts of the country troop to the Coast for the Easter holiday. Some 52 staff of The Nairobi Hospital have so far been diagnosed with cholera since the outbreak was first reported on Tuesday. Due to the influx of visitors, especially from Nairobi, the Mombasa County government is now on high alert in bid to ensure the disease does not spread to the tourism hub. Chief Public Health Officer Aisha Abubakar and Health executive Hazel Koitaba said the county is monitoring the situation to ensure the disease does not spread to the coastal town. ENHANCED SURVEILLANCE “We have enhanced surveillance on acute watery diarrhoea cases, intensified visits to health facilities for active case search and supplied chlorine, ropes and pots to sub-counties for treatment of water sources especially in high risk areas such as slums,” Ms Koitaba said. Dr Abubakar said health officials have intensified inspections of food premises and water sources. “We have mapped out a weekly reporting by health facilities [which has been] scaled up through regular visits to the facilities,” added Dr Abubakar. The official also urged residents and visitors to observe hygiene by washing their hands and eating only at licensed food joints. Hundreds of Nairobi and upcountry residents have trooped to the Coast region for the Easter festivities. The county has said that it has put enough measures to ensure that cholera does not spread to Mombasa. Most travellers to Mombasa visit public beaches and Swahili food joints.   County health chief officer says the disease might have come from Mlolongo.
