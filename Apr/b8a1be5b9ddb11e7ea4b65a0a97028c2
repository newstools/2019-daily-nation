Khartoum Protest leaders in Sudan have said they have broken off contacts with the ruling military council that replaced ousted leader Omar al-Bashir. They accused it of being composed of "remnants" of Mr Bashir's regime. Thousands of protesters who gathered outside army HQ in Khartoum for a meeting to announce a civilian council they now want to take power. The military says it is committed to handing over power and will consider a joint military-civilian council. REGIME However, protest movement spokesman Mohamed al-Amin said they now considered the military council an "extension of the regime" and vowed to escalate the protests. The campaign to remove Mr Bashir had been spearheaded by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA). It is behind the announcement of the council. The SPA held talks with the military on Saturday. Senior SPA member Ahmed al-Rabia initially indicated this might delay the naming of the council but on Sunday he confirmed that the announcement would go ahead at the Khartoum protest site. ELECTIONS The protesters want the council to form a transitional government, leading to elections. On Sunday it said it would respond to the call for civilian rule within a week, and indicated it might favour a joint council. It has, however, released political prisoners and on Saturday arrested a number of top members of Mr Bashir's former ruling party. While the military has promised not to remove protesters from their sit-in, it has also called on them to "let normal life resume".   After the army's announcement the celebrations evaporated, and the tone hardened.
