Tusker and Sony Sugar battled to a scoreless draw in a SportPesa Premier League match at Kenyatta stadium in Machakos on Thursday. Both teams created scoring opportunities but were unable to convert. The visitors suffered an injury blow on 35 minutes after Ambrose Ayoyi was stretchered off the pitch and Sony coach Patrick Odhiambo summoned Joshua Otieno in his place. Noah Wafula splashed Tusker's open chance at goal on 41 minutes when he skewed his shot after Timothy Otieno had perfectly flicked inside the area a dangerous header. Sony's Tobias Otieno saw his well-curled free kick ricochet off the crossbar from 20 yards with 10 minutes left on the clock. Tusker's Timothy Otieno was played through on goal by Jackson Macharia on 88 minutes, but sent wide his attempt with only Sony goalkeeper Kevin Otieno to beat. The draw lifted Tusker fourth on 38 points after 24 matches, while Sony seventh on 35 points from 23 games.   Isuza ensured his name was on the score sheet two minutes after the restart.
