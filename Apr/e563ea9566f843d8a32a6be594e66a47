Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho and Kirinyaga Woman Representative Purity Ngirici have been given five days to settle a debt of more than Sh6 million to an air company. Through lawyer Donald Kipkorir, Business Aircraft Management Ltd that operates as Flex Air Charters is demanding Sh2,534,768 from Mr Joho. The company is also demanding Sh3,886,387 from Ms Ngirici. It is alleged that the two hired helicopter services on different dates in 2016. The company said it raised invoices but the two paid part of the amount and were left with outstanding balances. The letter from Mr Kipkorir said the Mombasa County boss hired the services on diverse dates between October 7 and 17, 2016, at a cost of Sh4.4 million. But Mr Joho allegedly is yet to pay a balance of Sh2.5 million. For Ms Ngirici, the letter said, she hired the services between May 8 and August 17, 2016 and incurred a cost of Sh5.9 million. She was left with an outstanding balance of Sh3.9 million. “Note that if the said sums are not paid as demanded aforesaid, we have instructions to file at your risk as to incurred costs and incidentals thereto,” Kipkorir said in the letter dated April 25. Both were given five days to settle the debt.
