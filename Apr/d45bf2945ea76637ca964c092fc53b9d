Ushuru and Wazito FC lost their weekend matches surrendering their top two positions in the National Super League (NSL) respectively. With 12 rounds left, Kisumu All Stars are the new leaders, while Wazito, who slipped against Eldoret Youth, were dislodged from second spot by Nairobi Stima, who were held at home by visiting Green Commandos on Sunday All Stars, who had an impressive 2-0 win over Migori Youth in Kisumu, have a one-point advantage at the top on 53 points from 26 matches, same as second-placed Nairobi Stima, who have scored 39 goals to All Stars’ 44. Nairobi Stima could have gone top of the table with a win against Green Commandos, but they had to settle for a 1-1, even after dominating the entire 90 minutes in Naivasha. Shabana edged third-placed Ushuru 2-1 at Gusii Stadium to move from 10th to ninth. Despite beating Modern Coast Rangers 2-1 at Hope Centre, Nairobi City Stars are still stuck in the relegation zone, as are Thika United, who failed to use their vast experience to dominate their weekend match away to Administration Police, which ended 2-2 at the Camp Toyoyo in Nairobi. Coach George Owoko of Nairobi Stima admitted that there are areas they need to improve to before taking on Thika United away in their next fixture. According to Owoko, their main concern lies in the attacking force. “We created a lot of chances in our match against Commandos which we failed to convert. We played very well, but our biggest problem was putting the ball in the net,” said the former Gor Mahia assistant coach.
