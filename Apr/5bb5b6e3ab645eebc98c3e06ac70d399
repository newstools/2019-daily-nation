Makueni police on Tuesday arrested two officials of the Kenya National Union of Teachers over the disruption of a teacher training on the new curriculum. Secretary Gabriel Kisilu and Treasurer Mirriam Mwania were arrested for allegedly leading junior officials in disrupting the exercise at Isunguluni Primary School, said Kibwezi Sub-County Police Commander Ben Changulo. They were locked up at Kibwezi Police Station and will be charged on Wednesday. "We are looking for others," Mr Changulo has told the Nation. IG'S WARNING Some union officials disrupted the training in their regions after it kicked off on Tuesday. As a result of the report, Inspector-General of Police Hilary Mutyambai warned that stern measures would be taken against those interrupting the government exercise. “Instructions have been given to our county and sub-county commanders, under the supervision of regional commanders, to ensure the training continues uninterrupted," he said in a statement. “We shall not allow anyone to unlawfully sabotage legitimate activities of the government ... those culpable will be apprehended and dealt with according to the law." COUNTY WARNING Makueni County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim issued a similar warning while overseeing Huduma Namba registration at Kinyambu Market. "We are not going to tolerate anyone disrupting a government programme," he said. Some teachers who spoke to the Nation said they would only attend the training if Knut instructed them to attend. "The training should have been delayed until the reopening of schools. Training during the holiday inconveniences our colleagues transferred to distant stations," said one who was ejected from Kibwezi Township Primary School after the training was stopped.   Those who disrupt training on the new curriculum will be arrested, police service says.
