Chaos erupted during the launch of the Mulmulwas Movement in Kapenguria on Friday evening after two rival groups clashed. Supporters of West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo and those of Dennis Ruto Kapchok, the leader of the Mulmulwas Movement, engaged in running battles and fights. Earlier Friday, county officials stopped preparations for the launch saying the group had not paid fees Chelang’a Gardens, the venue of the event. The officials also said the venue had been booked by a local church. Later in the day, supporters of the governor thronged the venue where they danced and chanted slogans. When members of the Mulmulwas Movement, clad in red T-shirts and caps, arrived at the venue, they were attacked by the rival group who tried to scuttle the meeting. Business in the small town came to a standstill as people ran for their lives. Mr Kapchok, a critic of Prof Lonyangapuo's administration, formed the Mulmulwas Movement after the county boss labelled him mulmulwas (a roundish thing). Mr Kapchok said the movement aims at ensuring transparency and accountability at the county level. “The Kenya we want can only be created by us, the people through desire, action and self determination. The people, however, must be empowered with knowledge and reason before they can powerfully rise to the occasion,” he said.Mr Kapchok accused Governor Lonyangapuo of funding people to disrupt his meeting. When contacted by Nation, Prof Lonyangapuo denied the claims and said the group has a right to conduct their meetings.
