A family of 10 was left homeless on Saturday by a fire that razed its house at Sariti village in Kinangop constituency, Nyandarua County. Mr David Karanja, owner of the eight-room house, said they had been working at their farm when a neighbour informed them of the incident. “We found everything [gone]. I cannot tell the cause of the fire. I am very disturbed. We did not leave anything cooking when we left for the farm. We have lost property worth more than Sh2 million," he said. The father of eight said neighbours tried in vain to put out the fire. One Esther Ndung’u said it started shortly before noon. “I saw huge smoke emanating from the house. I alerted neighbours who came in large numbers but the fire was too much for them,” she said. Mr Karanja's wife, Ann Mukami, said, “School reopen next week. We are not sure how and if our children will report for the second term. Their uniforms and learning materials were all consumed in the fire. I appeal for assistance from well-wishers."       Residents in Meru village say they were unable to put out the fire.
