Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has assured Kenyans of maximum security during the Easter holiday. Speaking Thursday during a press brief at his office, Mr Mutyambai also announced a crackdown on motorists and motorcyclists who will flout traffic rules. “We have police officers working together with National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) officers to ensure Kenyans are safe on the roads,” said the IG. He disclosed that over the last three years, 100 people have died as a result of accidents on the roads during Easter holidays. TRAFFIC RULES “We are asking public service vehicles as well as boda boda operators across the country to observe traffic rules,” said Mr Mutyambai. He said out 988 people who have died this year as a result of road crashes, 362 were pedestrians. On Wednesday’s terror scare at Jomo Kenyatta International airport, Mr Mutyambai said there is no security threat, adding that a passenger declined to have his luggage inspected by the security officers, thereby causing the commotion. On the kidnapping of two Cuban doctors in Mandera, he said investigations are going on well but declined to give more information, saying once they are done they will inform Kenyans.
