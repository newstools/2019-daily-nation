Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka wants a commission of inquiry formed to investigate the dispute over the 54,000-acre Mwea Trust land in Embu County. The decades-old disagreement has seen Mbeere, Embu, Kamba and Kirinyaga people claim ownership of the property. During chaos over the land in 2018, several people were shot. It was at the memorial service of one of the victims, Mr Kennedy Muvevi Mutua, that Mr Musyoka said a commission was important. The politician told the government that the team would establish the rightful owners of the land and help end the dispute, as well as ensure the peaceful resettlement of the people. “The commission, if established, will carry out investigations and identify the genuine land owners so that our people do not continue dying,” he said on Friday at Makima village in Embu County. COMPENSATION Mr Musyoka further pledged to pile pressure on the government for Mr Mutua's family to be compensated. He said the families of six other people who were shot and seriously wounded during the chaos should also be compensated. “I will pursue the matter with the Attorney-General to ensure all the victims are compensated,” he said. The Wiper leader further said his law firm would represent the victims free of charge in the pursuit of justice, as "police officers erred when they opened fire on residents during the skirmishes". "Police were supposed to protect the people, not kill them," he said and noted the need for peace and unity in Kenya, through efforts such as the Building Bridges Initiative. During the memorial that Kitui Senator Enock Wambua and Masinga MP Joshua Mwalio also attended, money was raised in aid of the six survivors.   The suspension follows consultations between Lands and Interior cabinet secretaries.
