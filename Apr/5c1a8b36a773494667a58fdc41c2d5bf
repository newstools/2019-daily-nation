Bobasi lawmaker Innocent Obiri has pledged Sh2 million to facilitate the development of sports in the constituency. He spoke over the weekend, at Nyachogocho Secondary School and in the company of the region's Football Kenya Federation NEC member Joseph Andere, at an event where he also donated balls and uniforms to age-group football teams in the region. The first-term MP confirmed these funds will be drawn from the constituency development fund (CDF) and channelled towards among others, payment of affiliation fees for teams competing in lower-tier leagues in the region. "I am encouraged when I see our youth showcasing their talents and that's why we have come to support," said Obiri. "Our (Kisii) region has churned out some household football names including Henry Motego, (Henry) Nyandoro and even Mike Okoth, who became the best player in Belgium. Such successes should inspire you to work harder. I will do my best to ensure teams do not miss out on competing because of registration fees or lack of uniforms." He has also pledged to kit all teams from the region participating in the sub-county and county football leagues and also provide goal posts and nets in all pitches used for these competitions.
