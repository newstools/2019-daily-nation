Mathare United forced a 2-2 draw against hosts Vihiga United in a SpotPesa Premier League match at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega on Sunday. Determined Vihiga took the lead via Lawrence Luvanda through an indirect kick barely eight minutes into the match after Mathare‘s Andrew Ouma fouled Luvanda on the edge of the box. Mathare, who took time to settle down could have equalised in the 10th minute, when Clifford Alwanga’s left wing cross was headed over the cross bar James Kinyanjui. As the tempo of the encounter increased, referee Lucas Odhiambo cautioned Vihiga’s Luvanda for a foul against Andrew Ouma in the 23rd minute. Vihiga coach Sammy Okoth was forced to substitute injured Alex Imbusia in the 30th minute. His place was taken up by Dennis Wafula. In a bid to reinforce their outfits, both sides made substitutions after the breather. Sammy Okoth pulled out Kevin Muhanji and Lawrence Luvanda. Their positions were taken up by Victor Ademba and Andrew Murunga respectively. On his part, Mathare tactician Francis Kimanzi substituted Alfonse Ndonye, James Kinyanjui and Roy Okal. They were replaced by Klinsman Omukanga, John Mwangi and Arnold Onyango respectively. Stephen Wakanya put through Dennis Wafula and his shot went beyond the reach of goalkeeper Allan Owiny in the 68th minute to secure the second goal. Mathare, who last won the league title in 2008, pulled one back via Cliff Nyakeya in the 81st minute, following a long range shot which caught custodian Levis Opiyo off guard. Overlapping defender Johnston Omurwa equalised for the slum boys in the extra time after he capitalised on their opponent’s defence mix up. After the match, Vihiga’s new coach Sammy Okoth expressed delight at the result. “I came up with a playing pattern which the boys adapted very first. I am confident we shall perform well in the remaining fixtures,” he told reporters. “The home stretch is always full of surprises as each team wants to win their remaining matches," Kimanzi said.
