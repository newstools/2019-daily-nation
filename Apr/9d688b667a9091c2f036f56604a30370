Police in Nyandarua County, on Saturday arrested a man they found with documents including 611 birth certificates, seven death certificates, tens of birth notification certificates and photocopies of national identity cards. Kipipiri Deputy County Commissioner Mutuku Mwenga said the documents were found at a home in Geita village. “We suspect he is a member of a syndicate that fleeces members of the public seeking government services and documents of thousands of shillings. He retains the documents for victims who fail to pay in advance. It’s an illegal business,” said Mr Mutuku. Police also discovered a book of receipts issued for payments for these services. COLLUSION Mr Mwenga said preliminary investigations showed the suspect had been colluding with government officers who issue the documents. “We suspect he colludes with civil servants based in Engineer town in Kinangop, among other government offices. He will be charged with illegal possession of government documents," he said. Police laid a trap after members of the public complained of corruption and deliberate delays in issuing of the documents. They also protested against an increased number of brokers at government registries, saying they were given preferential treatment by corrupt civil servants. A resident told the Nation that the suspect demanded between Sh2,500 and Sh5,000 depending on the type of document and the urgency with which it was needed. WARNING Mr Mwenga advised the public against using brokers to access government documents and services. “There is a clear procedure on how any charges imposed by the government should be paid. One must also get a receipt for any payments for government services or documents," he said.   The military will carry out the recruitment until December 19.
