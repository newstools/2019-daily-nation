A court in Nakuru as denied bail to a suspect who allegedly escaped from police cells. Principal Magistrate Faith Munyi on Monday declared Mr Kevin Ojango a flight risk and ordered him detained at the Nakuru Central Police Station. The prosecutor told the court that Mr Ojango, who is also facing another charge, escaped from police custody and was arrested after a warrant issued for absconding court. He is said to have escaped from a police station on March 23 by sneaking through the report office using a fictitious name. The police report showed that he joined a group of other petty offenders who were being released from the police cell. But the suspect claimed the prosecutor was framing him. Ms Munyi in her ruling, however, noted that the reasons given by the prosecution persuaded the court to allow police detain him. The case will be mentioned on April 25.
