The Ministry of Education has already received Sh1.5 billion for infrastructural funding in schools and distribution will start soon, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has said. Every public school that requires infrastructural upgrade will get a portion of the money. The CS made the revelation Thursday at Jogoo Primary School in Kisii County as he addressed journalists after inspecting the ongoing training of tutors on the new curriculum. FAIR DISTRIBUTION "Under my leadership, we will ensure fair and equitable distribution of the fund. Corruption will not be condoned," said the CS. Prof Magoha, who joined over 300 teachers from Kisii Central undergoing the training, lauded them for agreeing to be part of the reforms in the education sector, which he said are for the benefit of future generations. The Kenya National Union of Teachers had called for a boycott of the training, but most teachers in Kisii as well as other parts of the country have defied the call. The CS also congratulated education stakeholders in the region for ensuring integrity in last year's exams. LIMITED CAPACITY The government is keen to address infrastructural challenges in secondary schools following the 100 percent transition policy that has left many schools grappling with congestion due to limited capacity. Ministry officials told the National Assembly Education committee chaired by Tinderet MP Paul Melly that the bulk of the money will go to sub-county and county schools which have mostly been affected by the transition policy. According to figures presented to the committee by former Education CS Ms Amina Mohamed, some 31,337 candidates were selected to join national schools, 128,838 joined extra-county schools, 148,215 went to county schools, 722,318 to sub-county schools and 1,626 to special needs institutions.
