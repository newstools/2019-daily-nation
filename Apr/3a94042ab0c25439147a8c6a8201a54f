Former Kibera Black Stars coach Godfrey “Solo” Oduor is delighted to have been appointed head coach of the SportPesa Premier League outfit Nzoia Sugar. Oduor penned a three-year deal with the Bungoma-based side, but watched their 3-2 defeat to Mathare United at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Wednesday from the stands. “I have to thank God for this opportunity,” an elated Oduor – who replaced Nicholas Muyoti- told Nation Sport in a one-on-one interview. Muyoti ditched the side for Kakamega Homeboyz in February. “I look forward to a successful outing in the Premier League, it’s a dream of any upcoming coach to handle a top-flight side and this is my platform that comes with a new challenge. I am happy and thank the club management for entrusting me with the job,” he added. Oduor, who also serves as the Kenya national Under-17 team assistant coach, said he will work on few weaknesses he noticed during the defeat to Mathare. “Nzoia is a good side with young players, who given proper training, can work as a team to win games. “Of course there’s pressure to deliver in any work place, but I believe the experience I picked from the second tier will be an added advantage here,” he concluded. The millers are 11th on the log with 28 points from 23 matches.   Kevin Kimani broke the deadlock three minutes after kick-off.
