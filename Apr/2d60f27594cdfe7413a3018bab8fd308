Avengers Endgame felt like a proper goodbye for the Marvel sequel which created an interconnected world of superheroes with Iron Man as its first. Twenty-two films. Eleven years. Last Wednesday, a number of the comic’s fans were treated to the first screening of the movie in East Africa. The premiere, which was held at the Garden City Mall courtesy of Blaze, saw the moviegoers enjoy the three hours and one minute film, which provides a possible ending for the series’ original crew, including Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk. It recently topped ticketing service Fandago’s list of the most anticipated movies of 2019. Ten years ago, Iron Man kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe, paving the road to where we are now. It also began the storyline of Thanos, the Mad Titan who set out to collect the Infinity Stones. Since the 2008's Iron Man, Marvel has had a tradition of including post-credits scene with each of its movies. According to Technobuffalo, the "endgame" in Avengers: Endgame refers to a line spoken by 'Doctor Strange' in Avengers: Infinity War. Before giving the Time Stone to Thanos, he tells Tony Stark, "We're in the endgame now." With only a few Avengers left and half of the universe gone, the stakes have never been higher. Its filming began in August of 2017, and the official title revealed in December of 2018. The original premiere was in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019.
