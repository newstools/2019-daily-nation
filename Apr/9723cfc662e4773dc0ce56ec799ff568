National Land Commission former chairman Muhammad Swazuri, and over a dozen other ex-officials and businessmen have been arrested over alleged corruption. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) detectives picked up the officials from their homes in Nairobi on Wednesday morning. Their arrests are linked to fraudulent compensation for land acquired by the commission for the construction of the Mombasa Southern Bypass and Kipevu New Highway Container Terminal link road in 2013. The land belonging to Tornado Carriers Limited was initially valued at Sh34,501,110 in 2015 but the commission ended up paying Sh109,769,363 after Dr Swazuri ordered a second valuation. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said Dr Swazuri and the 23 other suspects would be charged with several economic crimes. Dr Swazuri and his colleagues will be charged with conspiracy to commit an economic crime, abuse of office, money laundering, financial misconduct and handling stolen property.  More follows.   Land commission's chief executive Chavangi Tom and two senior directors among those in police custody.
