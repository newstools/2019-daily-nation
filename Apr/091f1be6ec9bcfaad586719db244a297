LOS ANGELES Lou Williams exploded off the bench for 33 points as the Los Angeles Clippers upset the top-seeded Golden State Warriors 129-121 to keep their NBA playoff series alive on Wednesday. Williams finished with four rebounds and 10 assists on a night when the Clippers' strength in depth thwarted a 45-point display from Kevin Durant to frustrate the Warriors hopes of wrapping up a series victory. Williams made 12 of 19 attempts from the field while Montrezl Harrell delivered a huge performance off the bench as well, shooting 11-of-14 to finish with 24 points. Point guard Patrick Beverley had 14 rebounds as the Clippers pulled the series back to 3-2 before game six in Los Angeles on Friday. The Warriors had earlier threatened to cut loose in a high-scoring first quarter, piling on 41 points. But Clippers were able to exploit an uneven Warriors defensive display to remain within striking distance, restricting the reigning NBA champions to a four-point lead heading into the second quarter. The visitors outscored the Warriors 34-22 to take a 71-63 half-time lead and from that point Golden State were chasing the game. The Clippers opened up a 15-point lead early in the third quarter and they kept the Warriors at arms length until Durant inspired a late run in the fourth. A spectacular driving dunk by Durant edged Golden State 118-117 ahead with 2:40 remaining in the fourth as the momentum seemed to have shifted to the Warriors. But Williams drained a three-pointer and forced a foul for a four-point play and the Clippers were suddenly back in front at 121-118. Two more jumpers from Williams stretched the lead to 125-118 with just over a minute left before Danilo Gallinari's running layup put the Clippers nine points clear.
