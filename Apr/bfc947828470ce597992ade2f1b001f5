Businessman Yogesh Patel has accused tycoon Jimi Wanjigi, his wife and their two firms of using a shell company to defraud him of Sh56 million that was meant to be a deposit for a controversial 0.818-acre piece of land in Nairobi’s Westlands suburb. Mr Patel claims that Aureum Ltd — a company owned by Mr Wanjigi, his wife Irene Nzisa and Augustine Kairo Thuo — agreed to sell him the prime land for Sh260 million in June last year but the firm has now transferred the property to someone else and refused to refund his deposit. The businessman has sued through his Kenroid Ltd, which reached the sale agreement that is now at the centre of a battle for the land. PUBLIC LAND Kenroid now holds that Aureum was only a shell that received his deposit on behalf of Irene Nzisa Wanjigi, Tyl Ltd — Mr Wanjigi’s firm — and Mr Thuo. The firm adds that the land could be a public utility and may be among the parcels flagged in the 2006 Ndung’u Land Report, which detailed several grabbed parcels in Kenya’s history. But when the Nation perused the Ndung’u report on Tuesday, the disputed piece - LR Number 1870/II/200 - was not among those flagged. The land has now been transferred to Cissy Kalunde Musembi, a transaction that Mr Patel’s Kenroid wants reversed. REBRAND Court documents indicate Aureum was initially called Horizon Hills Ltd but rebranded after the Registrar of Companies revealed there was another company by the same name. The other Horizon Hills Ltd and its directors David Njenga, Samson Kuria, Henry Njoroge Njenga and Samuel Njuguna Chege have been enjoined in the suit. The defendants have until June 17 to file their responses to the suit.
