DAR ES SALAAM, President John Magufuli on Friday pardoned 3,530 inmates as the country commemorated the 55th anniversary of the Union. A statement signed by Home Affairs Permanent Secretary Jacob Kingu said 722 prisoners would be released immediately while 2,808 would complete their terms. “It is the government’s expectation that they will rejoin and cooperate with members of the society in nation building," Maj.

President Magufuli issued the pardon in line with his powers as stipulated in Article 45 (1) (d) of the Constitution.
