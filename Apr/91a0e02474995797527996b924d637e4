Jubilee Party candidate Ahmed Kolosh is leading in the Wajir West parliamentary by-election. Mr Kolosh has 2,065 votes against 882 of Kanu's Sheikh Ibrahim. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has received results from 21 out of 75 polling stations spread out in four wards: Arbajahan, Hadado/Athibohol, Adam Admasajide and Ganyure/Wagalla. The tallying is being done at Griftu Primary School under tight security. Earlier in the day, there were skirmishes at Wajir Girls High School and Habaswein polling stations after the candidates' supporters clashed over bribery claims. The exercise was also hit by mass failure ofÂ the electronic biometric kits. Thus, voting was extended in the affected stations by one or two hours.   IEBC boss Wafula Chebukati assures free and fair election.
