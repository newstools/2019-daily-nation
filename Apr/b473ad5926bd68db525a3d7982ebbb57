Football Kenya Federation (FKF) on Monday announced a bonus scheme for Harambee Stars players who will compete at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. FKF president Nick Mwendwa explained that each player in Stars 23-man final squad named by coach Sebastian Migne will receive atleast Sh750,000. Further, each member of the team will be entitled to another Sh250,000 for each game they win at the biannual sporting showpiece. The funds, according to Mwendwa, will be drawn from the Sh219 million budget released by the government to help prepare for the competition. These funds will also facilitate a three-week training camp for Stars in Paris next month, and also be used to pay the players Sh38 million bonus promised by Deputy President William Ruto upon qualification to this tournament. "The government has also committed to pay all the pending arrears payable to Migne. So all out focus now shifts to preparing the team for the tournament," said Mwendwa. Mwendwa spoke at a Nairobi hotel at an event where FKF announced a partnership with betting firm Betin, tours and travel firm Splash world, plus digital firm Pecarp Limited dubbed Shinda na Stars promotion, in which will ensure six lucky fans travel to Egypt to watch Harambee Stars travel to Egypt to watch the national football team compete at the Africa Cup of Nations. Anyone over the age of 18 is eligible to compete in this promotion. One needs a mobile phone with atleast Sh50 airtime. Participants will be required to send the word 'START' to 29881 to become eligible and thereafter send Sh50 to Paybill number 881881 to become eligible. Thereafter, one will have to correctly answer five questions to stand a chance of winning either a Sh5000 daily cash prize, Sh100,000 and Sh200,000 weekly and monthly prizes, plus the ultimate Sh1 million prize.
