Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday visited the home of the late Jonathan Toroitich Moi to condole with his family. He went to Kabimoi in Eldama Ravine accompanied by leaders including Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis and MPs Moses Lesonnet (Eldama Ravine) and Caleb Kositany (Soy). Dr Ruto, who arrived at around 3.40pm, was received by Jonathan's widow Sylvia Toroitich. He had a private meeting with the family. CANCER SCREENING Jonathan, the eldest son of former President Daniel arap Moi and a rally driver popularly known as JT, succumbed to cancer last Friday at a Nakuru hospital. He was 62. In his address to mourners, Dr Ruto urged Kenyans to prioritise cancer screening as the government improves strategies to battle the killer disease. He noted that screening helps medics detect the disease early, thereby increasing chances of survival. "We need to educate our people on the importance of visiting hospitals for cancer screening because if detected in the early stages, it can be successfully treated," the DP said. EULOGY Mr Ruto described Jonathan as his friend and a humble and hardworking man. He asked Kenyans to pray for the family of the former President. The DP later flew to Kuresoi to condole with the family of former Cabinet Minister Kipkalya Kones, following the death of his daughter Vicky Chebet Kones. Dr Ruto's visit came two days after President Uhuru Kenyatta visited ex-President Moi's home in Kabarak, Nakuru County. In his condolence message, Mr Kenyatta said Jonathan will be remembered for his pioneering exploits as a rally driver, a successful farmer, a businessman and an entrepreneur.   "JT was a humble, kind, generous and courageous person," President Kenyatta says.
