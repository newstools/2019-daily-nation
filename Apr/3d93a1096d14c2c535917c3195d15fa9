Four police officers were on Tuesday detained for five days amid investigations into claims of bribery and extortion following the arrest of a businessman. Oliver Tambo Mayavi, Kevin Brian Adanje and Duncan Wasike, of Railways and Kamukunji police stations, and prison warder Joseph Dida Gumi allegedly demanded a bribe of Sh4,000 from trader Joe Gakure Muburi. Documents filed in court showed that the four, with others at large, arrested Mr Gakure on April 13 and threatened to take him to court. They later handcuffed him and took him to Central Police Station before demanding the bribe. WHAT HAPPENED Mr Gakure reported the incident to the divisional police commander at Central Police Station. He alleged that the officers handcuffed him in the company of others from the Flying Squad and that they threatened him. Mrs Nzibe heard that the policemen subjected the complainant to mental anguish, by taking actions such as driving around with him through the night. Mr Gakure allegedly gave them Sh4,000 to secure his release but was never charged. POLICE PLEA Mr William Kibue, the investigating officer, said he needed more time to record statements from witnesses and the complainant, liaise with the prison department to arrest more warders involved in the arrest and conduct an identification parade. Mr Kibe added that the suspects were dangerous and could interfere with investigations, and that they were also flight risks. The officer pleaded for seven days, saying it was sufficient for him to complete the probe, but Resident Magistrate Muthoni Nzibe granted him five days. The magistrate ordered the suspects detained at Central Police Station.   Kwale AP boss said they will be punished if found guilty
