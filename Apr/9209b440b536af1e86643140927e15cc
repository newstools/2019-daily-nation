The Nairobi court ordered the suspects remanded at the Kilimani Police Station until Tuesday afternoon when the it will rule on their bond applications. The suspects were charged with offenses ranging from abuse of office, money laundering, dealing with suspect property, unlawful acquisition of public property to conspiracy to commit a corruption offence. The accused persons are: Mr Kidero, Mr George Wainaina Kariuki, Mr John Ndirangu Kariuki, Mr Paul Mutunga Mutungi, Mr Manasseh Karanja Kepha, Ms Philomena Kavinya Nzuki, Mr Ng'ang'a Mungai, Ms Charity Muringo Ndiritu, Mr Peterson Andrew Njiru, Mr Ekaya Alumasi Ghonzour, Mr James Mimi Mbugua, Ms Elizabeth Wanjiru Nderitu, Ms Alice Njeri Mundia, Mr John Ngari Wainaina and Ms Hannah Muthoni Kariuki. A firm identified as The Clips Ltd was also been listed among the accused persons. Only 13 accused persons were present in court at the time of taking plea while two others were absent but their names were read out. Among the accused are several former accountants who worked at City Hall in 2014 when the alleged offenses were committed. While requesting the court to release them on bond, lawyer James Orengo, who is representing Dr Kidero alongside Mr Nelson Havi, Mr Peter Kaluma and Ms Julie Soweto, pleaded to have them freed on Monday. The request was denied. Only one suspect, Mr John Ndirangu Kariuki, was freed on Sh5 million bond because his lawyer told the court he is to undergo medical treatment on Tuesday.
