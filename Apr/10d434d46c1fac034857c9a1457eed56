Hello Brenda, I’m 34 and the mother of a baby girl. I was speaking to a guy friend recently who told me that I had approached my sell-by date of getting married and should just focus on my studies (I went back to school), because I could not land a husband. Surely Brenda, is there such a thing as a sell-by date for women? I also don’t want to have any more children and he said it was impossible to get a man who did not want children as well. What do you think?  Nonsense. Don't let some ignorant and backward man's view of marriage and woman affect your thriving life. A sell-by date? Are you a packet of milk? Just because he doesn't want a mature woman who comes with a wonderful child, definitely doesn't mean that there isn't a man out there who doesn't. And besides – a lot of men are coming with their own children as well, looking for love as well. You and I both know many women who have gotten married with all their children, and so we both know for a fact that it isn't true. Unnecessary stigmatisation of single others, and women in general, if the news is anything to go by, needs to STOP. I hope you laughed in his face and went on your merry way. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
