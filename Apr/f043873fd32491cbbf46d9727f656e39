A lorry overturned on Naivasha-Mai Mahiu highway on Tuesday, leaving motorists stuck in traffic for more than four hours. Naivasha Assistant County Commissioner Julius Nyaga said motorists who obstructed traffic as they sought alternative routes made matters worse. â€œThe lorry had been ferrying heavy cargo when the incident occured at around 4pm," he said, adding both sides of the road were affected. The snarl-up stretched from Mosque, a place near Mai Mahiu town where the accident occurred, to Lari. Caught up in the early evening jam were motorists ferrying goods across East Africa. The traffic was later cleared.
