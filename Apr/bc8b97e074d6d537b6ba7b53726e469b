Jericho All Stars on Saturday achieved a 2-1 win over Kasarani’s Bright Star Academy to set up a mouth-watering clash with South B United in the Nairobi region final of the Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom youth tournament. South B United had earlier on beaten Uweza FC 2-0 to qualify for the Nairobi region finals which will be played on Sunday at the Goan Gymkhana grounds. Winners in Sunday’s final will receive a Sh200,000 cash reward before proceeding to the national finals set for June 2019 at Kinoru Stadium, Meru. Runners up will pocket Sh100,000 each. In the girls’ category, Carolina For Kibera beat Dagoretti Mixed School 4-3 in post-match penalties to storm the finals after their match ended 0-0 in normal time. The other semi-final in the ladies category saw Acakoro Ladies beat Makadara’s County Queens 4-1 courtesy of goals from Florence Achieng, Sylvia Makhungu (brace), and Catherine Awuor. Millicent Lukoje scored the sole goal for the county queens. The girls’ finals will therefore involve Carolina For Kibera FC and Acakoro Ladies as they battle for the Nairobi region’s top honours. “We have had a good game though the ground was muddy and slippery. We are ready for the finals tomorrow and we hope to win. It is our hope to also see more of our players selected to join the All-Star team that will go to Spain for the training,” said Carolina coach Fredrick Odhiambo. At the grand finale the winning boys’ and girls’ teams will each walk away with Sh1 million in prize money among other individual prizes.
