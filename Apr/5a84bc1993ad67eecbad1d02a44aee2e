Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has signed an agreement with the British government that will allow the Malindi municipality to benefit from Sh7.2billion (£60 million) for the Sustainable Urban Economic Development programme. The five-year initiative aims to support 10 fast-growing municipalities in the country to develop sustainable urban economic plans and attract investment. Speaking during the signing of the deal at the county assembly building in Malindi, Mr Kingi said the grant will address challenges that come with urbanisation. He was accompanied by British High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey, a delegation from the UK Aid and county government officials. “Malindi is a historic town that began as a fishing village and later became known for slave trade,” he said. “Since independence, planning has never been done to the resort town whose economy depends on tourism.” Malindi, though it has hosted several prominent people in the world, still suffers because of poor planning as some parts of the town cannot be accessed in case of an emergency, he said.
