An American tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott and her tour guide Jean Paul Mirenge, who were recently kidnapped in Uganda’s most popular safari park Queen Elizabeth National Park, have been found alive. The two were reportedly found at Ishasha in the Kanungu District in the Western Region of Uganda bordering DR Congo. Four kidnappers stopped a group of tourists at gunpoint around dusk on April 2, 2019 as they drove through the Queen Elizabeth National Park on safari to see wild animals. A joint search operation for the abductees has been on since their abduction with the army, police and Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) personnel scouring the area and its vicinity. Details on how they were rescued were not readily available by press time. Mr Bashir Hangi, the UWA spokesperson, on Sunday told Daily Monitor that the abductees had been found before promising to provide more details later."[It's] true, details to follow later," he replied to a WhatsApp message from this reporter. After their abduction, the kidnappers reportedly demanded for $500,000 ransom using Ms Endicott's phone.   Gunmen abducted an American tourist and her driver inside Queen Elizabeth National Park.
