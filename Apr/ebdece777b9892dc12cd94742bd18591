The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has intervened in the bizarre case of two identical girls who claim they were separated at birth at Kakamega County Referral Hospital. The DCI on Thursday asked the families involved to file reports at its offices in Kakamega town. The directorate said “forensic investigations will establish if any criminal act was committed or if any mitigating circumstances led to the present status”. “We encourage and appeal to the families concerned to please report to the DCI office in Kakamega to facilitate the investigations." BUZZ For the last two days, the story of Sharon Mathias and Melon Luteyo, who appear identical, has caught the attention of the public. The family of Richard Lukoa has been raising Mevis Imbayi and Melon at their home in Likuyani, Matunda, Kakamega County, whereas Sharon has been staying with her parents in Kangemi, Nairobi. Sharon and Melon grew up without knowing about each other’s existence but things changed when they joined high school. Currently, Melon and Sharon are Form Four candidates at Kongoni Secondary and Shikoti Girls' school, respectively, in Kakamega County. The DCI's reaction came as the girls born in 1999 prepared to leave Kakamega for Nairobi, where they plan to stay at the home in Kangemi. DNA TEST The girls' looks have puzzled not only the people known to them but also the mothers who brought them up. They believe they are identical twins and have asked the government to help them get answers by conducting a DNA test. So far, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) has offered to carry out the test. The girls have said they will not separate if the tests prove they are not twins as they are 'bound by their looks'. Should the tests prove what they believe, detectives will have to find out whether they were swapped intentionally or by mistake.   Sharon Mathias and Melon Lutenyo claim they were separated at birth 19 years ago.
