A move by former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo to accompany Deputy President William Ruto to a church service in Molo, Nakuru County has set tongues wagging. Coming amid deep divisions in the ruling Jubilee Party his appearance has left many guessing why he is warming up to Mr Ruto, whom he once told not to expect support from central Kenya in 2022 General Election. Mr Kabogo blamed Mr Ruto for his defeat in the 2017 gubernatorial election after he was floored by Mr Ferdinand Waititu in the Jubilee Party primaries. The former county chief claimed that the DP authored his downfall by sponsoring Mr Waititu’s candidature to silence him. Mr Waititu has been a loyal member of team Tanga Tanga that has been drumming support for Mr Ruto’s 2022 bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. Other leaders who accompanied Mr Ruto to the Israel Assembly of God Church in Molo, Nakuru included: Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika, Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara, Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria, Kuresoi South MP Joseph Tonui, Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungwa, Njoro MP Charity Kathambi and host MP Kuria Kimani.   MPs Alice Wahome and Mary Waithira say factions have plunged party into politics of hatred and division.
