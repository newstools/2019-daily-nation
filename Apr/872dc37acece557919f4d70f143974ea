The number of murder cases crossed the 1,000 mark last year as crime statistics painted a grim picture for the country investing billions of shillings in the security sector. The 2019 Economic Survey shows that the total number of murder cases registered increased from 956 in 2017 to 1,065 in 2018.  This represents an 11 per ent rise or 109 more people murdered than the previous year. MURDER CASES During the same period, the number of convictions for murder cases obtained at the High Court increased from 354 to 357. The report notes that the registered murder cases in 2018 varied across High Court stations with the highest number being recorded in Eldoret. The last time the country registered more than 1000 murders in a year was in 2014. The report says there were 90 cases of murder in Eldoret, 88 in Nakuru, 79 in Meru, and 66 in Nairobi, making the urban areas the deadliest for the crime whose conviction attracts capital punishment. It comes at a time when Kenyans have woken up to shocking cases of murders, some crimes of passion, with young university girls and married women increasingly falling victims. The report does not however give a breakdown of murder by gender. In the year under review, the total number of crimes reported to the police increased by 13.2 per cent from 77,992 in 2017 to 88,268 in 2018 with crimes involving dangerous drugs reported to have increased by 44.1 per cent.
