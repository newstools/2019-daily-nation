Young graduates will soon need only internship experience at a government agency to qualify for government jobs, the National Youth Council (NYC) has said. NYC Chair Fatuma Abubakar said they have been negotiating with the Kenya National Employment Authority (NEA) to enable young people to get government jobs after undergoing internship. “The issue of young people being told that they need three years' experience before being promoted will be a thing of the past,” Ms Abubakar said, adding that internship will be considered part of one’s professional experience and is all that will be required for one to qualify for certain positions. Referring to the terrorist attack in Nairobi last week, she said the radicalisation of young people is made possible by lack of employment and income-generating opportunities. “Through county forums, we will sensitise young people, tell them about job placements, and about technical and vocational educational training programmes,” Ms Abubakar said. She was speaking when during the handing over ceremony to the council's new chief executive officer, Mr Roy Sasaka, at the council’s offices in Nairobi. Mr Sasaka promised to ensure full implementation of the council’s first strategic plan, which was recently launched by Deputy President William Ruto. “Key projects to be implemented in the near future include: the finalisation and review of the National Youth Policy, inter-generational dialogue forums for university students touching on the President’s 'Big 4' agenda, county youth engagement forums and the operationalisation of the National Youth Council Act,” Mr Sasaka said. . He replaced the council’s first CEO Mr Raymond Ochieng.   Considering its objectives, the NYS is an integral institution that is core to national development.
