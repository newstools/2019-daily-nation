At the same time, the match - which was to be played next Friday has been moved to January 13 - at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani from 4pm. The return leg will be played in Limbe on January 20. Guirat Haythem will be the centre referee while compatriots Yamen Malloulchi and Khalil Hassani will serve as the first and second assistant referees respectively. Gor dropped to Africa's second tier interclub competition after falling 2-0 to Lobi Stars of Nigeria in the Caf Champions League first round second leg to bow out on away goals following a 3-3 aggregate score. K’Ogalo won the first leg 3-1 at Kasarani stadium. This is the second time Gor find themselves in the same situation after edging out South African outfit SuperSport United on away goals after a 2-2 aggregate score to reach the money-spinning group stage of the Confederation Cup last season. They finished third in Group “D” on eight points, three behind USM Alger and one below Rayon Sports of Rwanda who both qualified for the quarter finals.
