Gabriel Ogweno, the third-best boy in last year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examination, has finally joined school after getting sponsorship for his secondary education. Master Ogweno, who is aspiring to become a software engineer, reported to Maranda School on Friday after his fees and other needs were met by the foundations of Akothee, a musician, and J Blessing, a renowned producer. “Akothee was touched by the boy’s story and has committed to seeing that he goes to school without any problem. The two foundations have committed to pay for his school fees until he finishes his secondary education,” said Ms Nelly Oaks, Akothee’s manager. The boy was flown from his home in Kajiado County to his new school in Siaya in partnership that Ms Oaks said also involved Silverstone Airline and Acacia Hotel. The 14-year-old-boy’s plight was highlighted by the Nation early this month. Master Gabriel scored 440 marks out of possible 500 at Our Lady of Mercy in Kitengela, Kajiado County and risked missing joining Form One at the over lack of school fees. The same fate also faced Julius Taiko, who scored 372 marks at the little -known Imbaruetin Community Complex Primary School in Kajiado South and was called to Loitoktok Boys. But the 16-year-old-boy, who stays with his widowed foster mother, has had lady luck smile on him as he will now pursue secondary education after receiving sponsorship from Equity Bank through its Wings to Fly programme for the bright but needy students.   Two bright students from Kajiado appeal for help to join high school.
