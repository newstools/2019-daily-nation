The Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) was on Monday granted five days to detain three suspects linked to the Al-Shabaab attack at the dusitD2 office complex in Nairobi on January 15. Mr Abdul Kibiringi, Mr James Mwai Mwangi and Ms Habiba Gedi Hunshur will undergo further interrogation, detectives told Nyeri Resident Magistrate Nelly Kariuki. The ATPU, through police constable Newton Mwangi, noted that the suspects were arrested on Friday night and that their call logs were yet to be obtained from mobile phone service providers. “The initial investigations show the suspects have a link to other suspects in the attack at Dusit hotel. Police are waiting for call logs data to finalise the investigations,” Mr Mwangi said in a miscellaneous application. He also cited the sensitivity of the matter, explaining that the three were being probed for conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism. MISSING SON Mr Kibiringi questioned his arrest, saying his son was the suspect, not him. “I was arrested while taking tea at a kiosk in town. Police told me I was wanted because of my missing son who is 26 years old and suspected to be connected to the attack," he said. "There is no need to have me in custody," he added. The other suspects did not address court. A police source said Mr Mwangi was from Kianjue village in Othaya and Ms Hunshur from Nyeri town. The magistrate granted police their request and said the suspects should be taken to court on Friday.   Detectives are still trying to establish the identities of the other suspects.
