Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) has fired Kenya Simbas head coach Ian Snook and his deputy Murray Roulston after they failed to spur the team to the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The Union’s chairman Richard Omwela said they engaged the two coaches from New Zealand for two years in March last year basing on deliverables. “Their main target was to help Kenya Simbas qualify for the 2019 World Cup but that didn’t happen,” said Omwela. “We can’t continue keeping them around when Kenya Simbas have no assignments.” Omwela said that they have been forced to terminate the pair's two-year contracts, hence they will be paid their two months salaries and the notice period of two months. “We are currently experiencing financial crisis hence we have no money to pay for the additional costs.” Snook replaced Jerome Paarwater, who was fired in December 2017, having handled the team since 2012. Paarwater almost guided the Simbas to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where the team failed to qualify on superior aggregate. Namibia got the nod during the 2014 qualifiers, alongside automatic qualifiers South Africa.
