IN DAR ES SALAAM Gor Mahia captain Harun Shakava has backed new signing Dennis Oliech to fire the Kenyan champions to a hat-trick of successive SportPesa Cup titles. While addressing a packed press conference at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday, the lanky defender also praised the impact of new coach Hassan Oktay at the club. "We will try and repeat what we did here two years ago, and win the title and get another chance to face Everton," said Shakava. "We have a number of new players and Oliech is one of them. He is slowly getting used to playing in Africa because he was based in Europe for most of his career. But already you can see he is an asset and we are banking on him to fire in the goals while also helping out in some attributes of the attack." Oliech, who enjoyed a decade-long stint in France, has scored twice in three league matches since joining Gor Mahia earlier this month. Now 33, he is expected to feature prominently for K'Ogalo at this eight-team tournament. Oktay said he trusts the playing unit as he eyes his first ever trophy in Kenya, and suggested he will shuffle his squad to curb the possibility of fatigue amid fixture congestion back at home. The English-based coach arrived in Gor Mahia last December, and has since led the team to the group stage of the Caf Confederation Cup after edging out Cameroon's New Stars de Douala in the playoff. "Winning at Gor Mahia is a habit and I want to be part of that. We have prepared in the best possible way and even though I haven't found time to study our opponents, I am sure we will deliver because I trust my players," explained the coach. Gor will commence their SportPesa Cup defence with a fixture against lowly Mbao FC from Mwanza on Wednesday.   The tournament semi-finals will be played on Thursday, paving the way for Sunday's final.
