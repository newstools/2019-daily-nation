Hi, This is not about me but about my neighbour’s house help, who gives the baby Piriton so that she does not disturb her. One day when I was at the balcony, I heard her bragging to her peers about it and I was so disgusted. The problem is that my neighbour is a suspicious and quarrelsome person. Most people around dislike her, and I don’t want to start trouble with her. What should I do?  Hi, Past this point, there is not much you can do about your horrible neighbour – because this is about the child, not about the neighbour. Maybe send her an anonymous note, so that she knows to keep a lookout for how her child responds, or asking the child herself. Medication to make a baby calm down, when it is your job to help the baby calm down, is not healthy at all. You definitely should say something now – and deal with your nonsense neighbour another day. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I have a good mind to keep the child away from him until he decides to man up.
