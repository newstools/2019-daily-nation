A 14-year-old boy from Makueni County may miss a chance to get secondary education over lack of school fees. Stephen Kasyoka attained 352 marks in 2018 KCPE exams and was accepted to join Kitondo Secondary School. But his parents cannot afford to pay the Sh19,458 school fees for first term or buy him the required necessities to enroll. Undaunted by his family’s financial hardship and his burning desire for education,  Kasyoka who wants to be doctor when he grows up, walked to Kitondo school and pleaded with the school principal to admit him. Unfortunately, the head teacher could not enroll him without the required school items and fees. Kasyoka, who is currently living with his aunt Rosemary Mueni is hoping a well-wisher will help him realise his dream of joining secondary school.
