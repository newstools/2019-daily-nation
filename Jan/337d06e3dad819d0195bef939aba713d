At least 22,000 needy students will receive Sh400 million from the presidential bursary following its launch by Labour and Social Services Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani in Marsabit yesterday. The Child Welfare Society of Kenya also distributed 460 bags of maize and 230 bags of beans as well as clothing and school bags to needy children. Chiefs are responsible for identifying orphans and needy cases in their locations. Only students admitted to public boarding secondary schools will benefit from the financial aid. TRANSITION The presidential bursary also seeks to support the government’s 100 per cent transition policy to secondary school given that thousands of students are locked out due to lack of fees. Under the programme, every constituency will receive Sh1.3 million while each student will get Sh30,000 per year. Marsabit County will receive Sh5 million.
