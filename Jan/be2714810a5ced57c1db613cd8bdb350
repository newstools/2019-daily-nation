Governor Anyang' Nyong'o was on Saturday admitted to Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu after feeling unwell during inauguration Archbishop Philip Anyolo. The medical superintendent at the hospital Dr Sam Oula said the governor arrived at the facility after he felt uncomfortable during an event at the Uzima University grounds in Kisumu. "He was feeling dizzy when he came and we have administered the necessary medication," Dr Oula said. The doctor said Prof Nyong'o is in stable condition, but will remain in the hospital for observation. A statement by his communication secretary Aloice Ager late Saturday stated that Prof Nyong'o was diagnosed with low blood pressure and put on bed rest. Prof Nyong'o was among guests attending the installation of Rev Anyolo as the new Kisumu archbishop. He has taken over from Archbishop Zaccheus Okoth who is retiring.   Rev Philip Anyolo was appointed by Pope Francis in November.
