A pupil in Homa Bay was on Saturday night defiled and her genitals cut in a brutal attack during a power blackout. The girl, 13, who is due to sit her Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examinations this year, was at home alone when unknown men under the cover of darkness, defiled her and cut her genitals using a razor blade, police said. Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum said his officers have arrested two suspects in connection with the gruesome attack. “We are looking for others who are believed to be connected to what happened,” he said. Her mother, who runs a kiosk in Homa Bay town, said her daughter was defiled when she was going to the toilet at 10pm. “She walked out of the house to help herself when suddenly two men who she did not identify appeared from the darkness,” she said. The minor was taken to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital. The incident has left residents of Shauriyako Estate where the minor and her family lives in fear and shock.
