The Mombasa County government on Friday began demolishing buildings declared unfit. Bulldozers were on Friday evening seen bringing down African Building and Estate Buildings located on Moi Avenue. "The tenants had been given a 30 day-notice to vacate the buildings. The premises under demolition had been marked as condemned buildings unfit for human occupation," Lands executive Edward Nyale said. He said they got a court order allowing them to cordon off the buildings. However, tenants sued CBA Mutuya Property Group Ltd, African Building and Estate buildings and Mugacha Chege Maina for preventing them from accessing the premises. Mombasa Resident Judge Eric Ogola issued temporary orders against the defendants pending the hearing of the suit. "A temporary mandatory injunction order be and is hereby issued against the defendants, jointly and severally, from erecting, barricading or in any manner impeding or preventing the applicants from entering, and/or accessing their business premises; and to remove the boarding and/or barricades erected around the suit property," the order said. But Mr Nyale said he is not aware of the directive. "What I know is that the court had issued orders to the effect that condemned buildings be cordoned off for safety. I am not aware of the new order unless we see it, read and interpret it." Other buildings earmarked for demolition are Motor Mart, which failed engineering and sanitation tests; residential flats located in Mikindani and Bamburi estates.
