Families and friends of those who died in the Dusit hotel complex attack gathered on Thursday at Chiromo Mortuary to identify bodies of their loved ones. A multi-agency team comprising Kenya Red Cross, St John's Ambulance and National Disaster Management Unit are also providing counselling services to relatives. Kenya Red Cross is currently registering details of persons who reported missing after the attack. A statement by Kenya Red Cross issued on Wednesday evening showed that 19 people were still not accounted for, hours after the security operation had ended with the killing of all the attackers. “Members of the public are encouraged to visit the nearest regional blood transfusion centres and donate blood,” Red Cross said in a statement. A mortuary attendant who spoke to the Nation in confidence said that many of the victims had gunshot wounds. He said there was one body that had not yet been identified. Bodies of two men were identified on Wednesday and taken for burial in accordance with Muslim tradition. The Inspector General Joseph Boinnet on Wednesday evening in his briefing gave the nationalities of the 21 who died in the attack as six Kenyans, one Briton, one American and three victims of African descent whose nationalities were yet to be determined. An Australian man who was on his first trip to Kenya to visit his university girlfriend was also among the dead. Mr Boinnet said two suspects have been arrested in connection to the attack. “They are in police custody and we have a reason to believe that they facilitated the attack. They are assisting the police with investigations,” Mr Boinnet said.   A police officer is among the victims.
