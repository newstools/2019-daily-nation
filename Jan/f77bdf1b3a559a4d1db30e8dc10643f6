MONACO Former Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry has been suspended from his role as coach of Monaco with his team second bottom of Ligue 1, the Ligue 1 club announced on Thursday. "Henry has been suspended until a definitive decision is made," the club said in a statement, adding that assistant coach Franck Passi would oversee training on Friday ahead of the weekend's clash with fellow strugglers Dijon. Henry took up the post with 2017 French champions Monaco in October but they have just three Ligue 1 wins after 21 games.
