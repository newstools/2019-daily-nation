An Ethiopian passenger plane on Thursday morning overshot the runway at the Entebbe International Airport, Uganda's Civil Aviation Authority says. Ugandan authorities said all the 139 on board the Boeing 737-800 aircraft with registration number ET-ATV disembarked safely. "This has affected mainly inbound international flights. Concerted efforts in liaison with Ethiopian Airlines and other stakeholders are ongoing to ensure removal of the aircraft from the runway and resumption of normal flight operations," said Ugandan authorities. In a Twitter post, the Ethiopian Airlines said the plane was not damaged during the incident and is being towed to the ramp. "An alternative flight is being arranged to complete the return flight and rebook the passengers, who were booked to travel from Entebbe to Addis Ababa," said the airline on Twitter.
