Local and foreign athletics coaches in the country have until Wednesday to register with Athletics Kenya (AK) or risk being banned from operating in the country or handling Kenyan athletes, the federation has said. In a statement sent to newsrooms Monday, AK treasurer David Miano said the process of registering local and foreign coaches will start at 9am at the federation’s headquarters in Riadha House, Nairobi. Miano advised local and foreign coaches operating in the country and those that handle Kenyan athletes to present their permits and other credentials at Riadha House. Miano noted that the process will enable the federation keep a database of all coaches operating in the country with a view to having them properly registered, approved and licensed to handle Kenyan athletes. “Let every coach take this seriously with an aim to comply. Failure to present oneself for this important exercise will force the federation to work with other government agencies to have disciplinary action taken against them,” warned Miano on Monday. The process comes weeks after AK met and vetted most of its registered athletes’ representatives and managers. “The registration of athletes is an ongoing process and is expected to continue until all athletes are covered,” Miano clarified, adding that no athlete will be cleared for any competition before being registered and being allocated Athlete Registration Number by the federation. Miano explained that the federation has also registered close to 46 athletes’ representatives and managers in the country. “We are not yet through with vetting the new ones since they will have to sit an IAAF examination for them to finally be certified,” Miano clarified, adding that a grace period will be given for foreign coaches who are out of the country during registration. “We shall fix a new date for them to be registered, but they must appear in person.”
