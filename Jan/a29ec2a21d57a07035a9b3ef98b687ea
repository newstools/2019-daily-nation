Public hospitals in Isiolo County have recorded at least a 40 percent increase in the number of patients seeking medical attention following the rollout of the Universal Health Coverage. County medical services chief officer Ibrahim Alio said the grand health, one of President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four Agenda, has also attracted patients from neighbouring Meru, Samburu, Garissa, Marsabit and Wajir counties to hospitals along the boundaries. The increase is also attributed to a delay in disbursement of UHC cards to Isiolo residents who have registered, prompting the administration to offer blanket services. Upon issuance of UHC cards, registered patients are required to present them at health facilities within the county to receive free services. "As at now, we have decided to offer free services to any patient that walks into any of our health facilities," Mr Alio said. FUNDS Once the county government completes registration and UHC cards are issued, those without the cards will pay the usual charges. Some residents from neighbouring counties have taken advantage to register for the programme. Already, the Ministry of Health has released UHC funds for the four pilot counties of Isiolo, Nyeri, Machakos and Kisumu to Kemsa and the devolved units for operation and maintenance of the facilities. Earlier, Governor Mohamed Kuti said the programme will improve emergency and mental care services, antenatal care through enhanced community service, availability of medicine and medical commodities, boost medical personnel and enhance referral systems in Isiolo.
