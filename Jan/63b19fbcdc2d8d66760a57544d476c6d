The government’s renewed vigour in the fight against corruption continues to draw praise, precisely because it is the right thing to do. Unfortunately, some hitches have hampered the realisation of the quick results that many would like to see. President Uhuru Kenyatta and other leaders have pointed the finger at the Judiciary for allegedly being rather lenient to the suspects by easily granting them bail. Of course, the Judiciary has come out to defend itself, throwing the ball back into the court of the investigators and prosecutors. DEDICATIONHowever, it is a fact that there has been progress in the fight against graft. By targeting both the prominent and ordinary Kenyans and hauling them to court, the government has shown commitment to finally taking the bull by the horns. And it will definitely be encouraged by the fact that 13 Western envoys have come out to laud this. And, they have pledged to support the fight. So rare in the past was such a statement by the envoys supportive of the government. These representatives of major donors to Kenya have always made their feelings known on the wrongs that bedevil the country. WARNING They have criticised poor governance, repression and, of course, high-level graft in the public sector. As representatives of their countries, they are of course here to articulate their own countries’ interests, but if they shut their eyes to the wrongs they see, they cannot escape criticism for condoning evil. We welcome the diplomats’ appeal to the government to prosecute all the suspects irrespective of their political party, social stature or personal connection. It’s only through meticulous investigations and prosecution to secure convictions that the government can send a strong warning to would-be offenders that they will be punished if found culpable.
