Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o faces his latest medical episode, which was described by his his communication secretary as a sudden drop of blood pressure. In recent years, the 73-year-old governor has been in and out of the hospital for various ailments. In September 2018, he was admitted to Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi with arm fracture. In December 2017, Prof Nyong'o underwent a hipbone surgery at the University of California Hospital in San Francisco. In an opinion piece in a local daily early last year, Prof Nyong’o wrote that for almost a year, due to the constraints of the campaigns and election calendar, he had been surviving on painkillers regularly prescribed by his pain management doctor. “Many may have observed me limping from time to time as we struggled for the betterment of our county and country,” he wrote. “Without going into much detail, I have all along been waiting for an opportune moment for the hip replacement surgery as the last solution to my problem.” In November 2016 while being driven to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for an early morning flight to Kisumu, the governor revealed that he had an accident on Kiambu Road. “On the face of it, nobody was injured, although the car was badly damaged. I, therefore, continued with my journey to Kisumu without worrying much about any injury whatsoever."   Kisumu County boss admitted to Aga Khan Hospital.
