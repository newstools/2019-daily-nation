Police in Kwale County have arrested four suspects linked to the murder of an elderly man on Wednesday morning. Coast Regional Coordinator Bernard Leparmarai said the 63-year-old man was killed following a land dispute. Zuma Ngome was hacked to death early morning by the unknown men at his home in Mito Minane village. Mr Ngome's daughter, Mwaka Zuma, said her father was attacked at around 1am. "My father was seated outside the house when the attackers came and slashed his head and cheek killing him instantly," said Ms Zuma. LAND DISPUTE The family said the attack happened a few days after the resolution by the village elders of a land dispute involving Mr Ngome and a neighbour. Ms Zuma said the decision over the ownership of a piece of land was not in favour of her father. "Since he did not agree with the decision he asked for 14 days so that he could move to court only for us to receive news of his death," she said. Speaking in an interview, Mr Leparmarai said the four who were arrested are believed to be part of the group that killed the elderly man. "We are in pursuit of two other suspects but let me assure you that we are going to bring all those involved to book," said Mr Leparmarai when he visited the village. CRACKDOWN The attack happened a day after Interior CS Fred Matiang'i assured Coast residents that security agents will intensify the crackdown against those killing elderly people over land disputes. “We know that some of the incidents are linked to land issues in the region but our colleagues in the Ministry of Land are working on those issues. Even then, there are no good reasons for one to cause the death of another,” said Dr Matiang’i. He spoke few days after another elderly man was killed in Kilifi on Sunday. At least 60 elderly people in Kwale and Kilifi counties were murdered in 2018 alone over land-related matters.
