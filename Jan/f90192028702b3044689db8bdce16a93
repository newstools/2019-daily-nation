A man in Wajir County has been sentenced to life in prison for defiling and impregnating an 11-year-old girl. The convict, Mohamed Dagane Abdi, was accused of forcing himself on the pupil at her parent’s house. The victim became pregnant and later gave birth through caesarean section because she was very young for normal delivery, the court was told. In his defence, Mr Abdi said he was framed because of the differences between his family and the girl’s. But, Wajir Senior Resident Magistrate Mugendi Nyaga found him guilty. While delivering the judgment, the magistrate said, the sentence will act as a deterrence to other people who are planning to commit such acts. The ruling is landmark in the county because on many occasion, victims refuse to testify against perpetrators of sexual violence for fear of being victimized by community members. The use of maslaha (alternative system of dispute and conflict resolution) in solving issues of rape and other forms of sexual violence in the county has been blamed for denying victims justice. The fact that a section of well-respected elders and chiefs have been part of the negotiating teams have made it difficult for victims to get justice. Wajir County Commissioner Loyford Kibaara, who commented on the judgment, said that it will serve as a warning to those who commit such acts thinking that they will eventually escape justice. “This judgment is  an indication that despite the long route, justice will finally be served to the victims who have always suffered both emotionally and physically after such incidences,” According to police reports, at least 10 rape cases were reported in the county in 2018, most of which are still in court. Habaswein Sub-County accounted for the highest number in the county last year. Three cases of defilement have been reported in Habaswein so far this year.   Inside the system that denies justice to victims of sexual abuse.
