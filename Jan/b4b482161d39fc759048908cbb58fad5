The body of rugby-playing Administration Police (AP) officer who went missing in November last year has been found in an Eldoret mortuary. Constable Vincent Kemboi, who was based at the Nairobi's Utawala area, was reported missing in November last year. His brother, Mr Geoffrey Kemboi said the officer’s body had a visible injury and that a post-mortem would be conducted to determine the cause of his death. “He reportedly disappeared while on his way to hospital and we have since been searching for him everywhere,” Geoffrey said, adding that the body was found on January 22. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has been searching for the officer but his phone signals showed he was last in Nakuru. AP's rugby team in their condolence message said: “Warriors shocked as news of Kemboi's death breaks. He could tackle, take the ball and took Warriors to places they never dreamed they would be."
