The Nzoia Sugar Company management has denied having a hand in the abduction and torture of Acting Managing Director Michael Kulundu and asked police to speedily apprehend the culprits. Board Chairman Joash Wamang'oli rebuked individuals claiming the Bungoma based-sugar milling firm had a hand in the incident. "PROPAGANDA" Mr Wamang'oli termed the claims as propaganda and appealed to anyone with information to give it to police. Addressing the press in the company’s boardroom on Sunday, Mr Wamang’oli said it was impossible and unthinkable for the company to abduct its own employee as an intimidation tactic as alleged. “On behalf of the board of directors, management and workers of Nzoia Sugar, I wish to highly condemn this act on our MD and also dismiss reports in some section of the media that the company might have been involved in the abduction and torture of Mr Kulundu. All those spreading these lies are out of their minds,” he said. REP'S CLAIMS The chairman's sentiments seemed to be directed at the company’s workers’ representative Macdonald Wamacho. Last Thursday, Mr Wamacho attributed Mr Kulundu’s abduction to the challenges the company is facing, including the appointment of a substantive managing director. Mr Wamacho also termed the abduction and torture of the MD as an attempted murder and assassination. The MD was kidnapped outside Salmond Restaurant on the Kanduyi-Sikata road around 8.30pm on Wednesday shortly after he was dropped off by his personal driver. He was found early Thursday morning by family members who had looked for him all night. Bungoma South police chief Patrick Nyangares said that they had launched investigations into the matter. Mr Kulundu was appointed the acting MD early in 2017 after the then managing director, Mr Godfrey Wanyonyi was suspended on charges of abuse of office. Mr Wanyonyi was suspended alongside six senior managers.   Family says he was found in a trench 100m from the restaurant where he was allegedly abducted from.
