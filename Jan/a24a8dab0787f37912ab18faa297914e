Shabana FC’s slump continued on Wednesday when they went down 1-0 to Eldoret Youth in a National Super League match played at Eldoret Showground. The defeat dealt a further dent to Shabana’s Premier League ambition as they slid down the log to seventh position with 13 points from four wins and single draw after eight matches. Eldoret Youth scored in 29th minute through Joseph Oyugi, Shabana disputing bitterly the goal and had their coach Gilbert Selebwa sent off for dissent. The match was temporarily  stopped as both sets of fans engaged in near physical confrontations before ant-riot police officers restored normalcy. The hosts thought they had doubled their lead in 69th minute but Kevin Cheti’s strike was ruled out for offside. Shabana’s Oscar Oketch and Anderson Ongwae’s lead their team’s sporadic attacks on a resolute Eldoret’s rearguard, with keeper  Richard Ebenyo superbly directing the defence from the posts. This was Eldoret’s fourth win of the season and have now climbed to sixth with 14 points, one ahead of Shabana. Eldoret’s team manager Anderson Sango was satisfied with three points gotten off an experienced side. “Shabana has been here for a very long time. My boys came into this match well prepared,” he said. Shabana’s Selebwa stormed off telling gathered journalists to engage match officials for reactions on the ill-tempered match. Sango has at the same time appealed to well-wishers to help the team in footing their financial expenses. There was a fundraiser after the match as the team seeks funds to enable it mount a successful challenge for Premier League promotion. He said that Eldoret Youth was the town’s chance to bring back lost glory that they enjoyed when Rivatex and KCC dominated Kenyan football. “We need more financial support for the team as at the moment we only get support from Maggies Hotel that has ensured that we never miss any away match,” he said.   Football Kenya Federation Nick Mwendwa led tributes.
