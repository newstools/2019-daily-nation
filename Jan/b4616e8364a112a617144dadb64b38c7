Kosgei, who had a good season winning various local races, is using the road races as part of her build-up for a major marathon this year. "It was a tough race for me because the athletes we were competing with are very good in track but I'm happy I was able to cross the line first. I'm preparing for a major marathon and this is part of training for me," said the Kapsait-based athlete. On her part, Obiri said she was happy to clock a personal best on her debut in the race. "The race was good and I'm happy with the results because it's my first time to run in 10km. It was tough but I managed to come in second which is a good sign of things to come this season," said the 5,000m Commonwealth Games champion. Obiri also said that she is preparing for the National Cross Country trials set for next month in Eldoret as she seeks to be in the team that will be heading to World Cross Country Championships to be held in Aarhus, Denmark in March. Obiri won silver medal in 5,000m during the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She is also the 2012 World Indoor champion in 3,000m and silver medallist in the same event in 2014.
