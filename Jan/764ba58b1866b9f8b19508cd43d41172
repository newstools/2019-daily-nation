EDITOR'S NOTE:An article on the sale of photographs from the 14 Riverside Drive attack, published on this site earlier, contained inaccuracies which we wish to correct. The article suggested that Kenyan photographer Kabir Dhanji had put the photographs up for auction at a rate of Sh50,000 each. The article also erroneously referred to visual media company Getty Images as an auction firm. The correct position is that Mr Dhanji supplied his photographs to media agency AFP, which has a partnership with Getty to sell its photographs. The photographer will not earn any money from the sale of the photographs by Getty Images. We apologise to Mr Dhanji and AFP for the embarrassment and inconvenience the article has caused them.
