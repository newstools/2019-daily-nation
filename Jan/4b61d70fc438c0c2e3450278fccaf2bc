Meru Woman Representative Kawira Mwangaza has filed a report with the police after a threatening audio recording against her surfaced. She furnished the Meru criminal investigations office with the recording where a man claimed to be a sub-county administrator is heard issuing unspecified threats against her. In the 94-second recording between a Meru based reporter and the administrator, the official says they will teach Ms Mwangaza a lesson. PROTESTSThe man takes issue with the manner in which Ms Mwangaza’s Baite TV aired Wednesday’s demonstration by owners of private cars who were barred from ferrying passengers in Meru Town. But the order has been rescinded. He accuses the Woman Representative of a smear campaign against county authorities while positioning herself to contest the governorship post. "The TV station only aired the part where the demonstrators were throwing stones, but did not show the authorities addressing the matter. She is very stupid and we must teach her a lesson," the man fumes. Meru police boss Peter Kimani said they are assessing the audio clip. "The matter is being investigated by the DCI. She gave whatever evidence she had and the matter has to be investigated to identify whether there is an offence detected. We have to identify an offence."
