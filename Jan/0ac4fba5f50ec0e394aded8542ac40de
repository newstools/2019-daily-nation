Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich has on Wednesday warned leaders against politicising the upcoming national populations census. Mr Rotich said politicians’ utterances are likely to compromise the two-day exercise set to start on August 24, this year. “Let politicians give Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) a chance to do its work properly,” said Mr Rotich. Mr Rotich asked politicians who have issues with the exercise to wait for its completion before lodging complaints. "If you have any reason to challenge the process it must be on the basis of facts. That's the debate we want to have," said Mr Rotich. Mr Rotich also dismissed claims that the Kenyan census is more expensive compared to others in the region. By the time the study is completed, the government will have spent Sh18.5 billion allocated over the last three years, a cost Mr Rotich says compares favourably with international standards. The Treasury boss also warned the public against falling prey to social media posts on enumerator jobs, saying the reports are false. MUDAVADI CRITICISM KNBS has been on the spot from a section of the political class, who have challenged it to conduct a transparent exercise whose accuracy can be ascertained. In his New Year message, Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi warned KNBS against rigging the census pointing out that a transparent exercise with integrity shall ensure just and fair economic planning and development. “A rigged census will continue to perpetuate the economic and political injustices. This country has had issues with the manner in which census is conducted and the results thereof. The most recent census in 2009 is a good example of a flawed and inconsistent process that left the county hanging on the cliff-top of uncertainty,” Mr Mudavadi said.   For President Kenyatta, it might not be a happy and fulfilling 2019.
