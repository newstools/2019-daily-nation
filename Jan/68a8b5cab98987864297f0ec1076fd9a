A sterling second half performance helped champions Gor Mahia down Chemelil Sugar 2-0 in a SportPesa Premier League encounter at the Kenyatta stadium in Machakos on Wednesday. Nicholas Kipkirui drew first blood on 46 minutes before Boniface Omondi doubled the scores in the 52nd minute with a half volley from inside the box. Gor’s first victory in the New Year takes their tally to six, seven behind leaders Mathare United. K’Ogalo play Mathare United on Sunday at Kasarani. Gor piled pressure on the visitors from the moment referee Isaac Memusi blew the opening whistle. Omondi fed Jacques Tuyisenge with a deep cross on 14 minutes but the Rwandese effort was parried for a corner kick by Chemelil custodian Kevin Otieno. On 31 minutes, Lawrence Juma’s rasping shot from 20 yards hit the side netting. A minute later, Harun Shakava failed to guide his free header into the net after connecting to Francis Kahata's delivery from a freekick. The millers, donning yellow shirts and black shorts, sat deep to defend waiting to break on the counter. On 36 minutes, Boniface Omondi teed up Kahata but the latter’s left foot low drive was palmed away by Otieno for yet another corner that Tuyisenge headed to the roof of the net. Kipkirui, who paved way for Ivorian Ephrem Guikan on 58 minutes, scored into an empty net after Chemelil defenders failed to clear their lines. Lawrence Juma would then find Omondi with a long ball inside the box and the diminutive forward converted with a sweet half volley for Gor's second. Chemelil coach Francis Baraza introduced Biko Tindi for Felix Oluoch on 64 minutes. Gor coach Hassan Oktay preferred Frederick Odhiambo in between the sticks with Ernest Wendo doing the donkey work in the midfield as Lawrence Juma played behind the striking duo of Kipkirui and Tuyisenge. Francis Kahata and Boniface Omondi played on the flanks interchangeably before the former paved way for Samuel Onyango on 69 minutes.
