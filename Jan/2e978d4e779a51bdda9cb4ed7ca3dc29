Three suspects arrested in connection with the murder of former Kilifi Deputy Governor Kenneth Kamto will remain in custody for five more days as police complete investigations. Shanzu Principal magistrate David Odhiambo on Friday granted detectives the request. The suspects have not been formally charged. The police said they are still piecing together crucial information which they believe will help in fortifying their case. The suspects have been in custody for almost three weeks now and are set to take plea next week. Mr Kamto was shot to death at his home in Nyali, Mombasa, in December last year by unknown people. ROBBERY Preliminary police reports indicate the killers, who were wearing masks, confronted him at 4:45am as he entered his home and demanded cash before shooting him three times. Also, they robbed a security guard at the gate Ksh6,000. The three suspects were arrested by Homicide Unit detectives weeks later. A forth one was apprehended on January 6. A mobile phone alleged to have been stolen from Mr Kamtoâ€™s house girl was recovered. The three suspects will be arraigned on January 23.   The case will be taken over by a Nairobi homicide team.
