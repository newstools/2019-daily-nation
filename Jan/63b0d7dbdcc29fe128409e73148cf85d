Migori Governor Okoth Obado has reinstated one of his embattled County Executive Committee members. On Monday, the governor reappointed Mrs Elizabeth Ochaye, who was sacked last year over claims of political disloyalty having campaigned openly for Mr Ochillo Ayacko of ODM in the senatorial by-election. In the November 2018, Mr Obado made changes to his government after the gruelling senatorial campaigns which roped in county officials. The shakeup was meant to root out some of the officials who covertly gravitated towards ODM. DIFFERED WITH ODM Most of Mr Obado's handlers campaigned for Mr Eddy Oketch of Federal Party of Kenya after the county boss openly differed with the Orange party over the manner in which Mr Ayacko was picked. Mrs Ochaye will now head the Environment docket which was being headed in an acting capacity by Mr Moses Chamwada. Confirming the reappointment, the county government's Press Director Nicholas Anyuor dismissed allegations that Mrs Ochaye had issues with Governor Obado. "Mrs Ochaye has been reinstated and reported back on Tuesday. The governor does not have any problem with her. The governor is dedicated to offering services to the people of Migori," said Mr Anyuor. SECURE LEGACY Governor Obado has in the recent past reorganised his administration in a bid to secure his legacy that has been tainted with criminal charges and corruption allegations. He is under investigation in connection to the murder of his pregnant girlfriend, Sharon Otieno. He was released on bail having spent over a month in remand at the Nairobi’s Industrial Area Prison. In addition, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is looking into claims of misappropriation of Sh2 billion county funds. They raided his homes and office and confiscated – among other things – eight firearms, several bank statements and electronics, opening yet another case against the embattled governor.
