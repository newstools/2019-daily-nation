Former Kenyan international Dennis Oliech has officially joined Gor Mahia on a two-year deal, Nation Sport can reveal. The 33-year-old put pen to paper on Wednesday before being unveiled by chairman Ambrose Rachier. "We are happy to bring him on board for two seasons," club Chief Executive Officer Lordvick Aduda told Nation Sport. "As you know, we've been in search of a local striker and his signing is a reprieve. The coach was already impressed with him in training," he added. Oliech will compete for a starting berth in a star-studded team with Rwandese import Jacques Tuyisenge, Ivorian Ephrem Guikan and Ugandan international Erisa Ssekisambu. Oliech is fondly remembered for scoring a goal against Cape Verde in 2003 that confirmed Harambee Stars' ticket to the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia. He has 37 goals in 77 appearances for Kenya. The former Mathare United man last played a competitive match in June 2015 when Kenya fell 2-1 to Zambia in a 2017 Afcon qualifier match at Nyayo stadium.
