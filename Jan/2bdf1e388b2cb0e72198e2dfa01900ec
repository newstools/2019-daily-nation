An American who survived the 9/11 terror attack is among those who were killed in Tuesday’s terror attack at Nairobi’s 14 Riverside Drive. Jason Spindler’s mother Sarah Sandler told NBC News that her son “was trying to make positive change in the third world in emerging markets.” Spindler’s brother, Jonathan, also confirmed the family’s tragic loss via Facebook. “It is with a heavy heart that I have to report that my brother, Jason Spindler passed away this morning during a terror attack in Nairobi, Kenya. Jason was a survivor of 9/11 and a fighter. I am sure he gave them hell!” Jonathan’s post read. 'HAVING LUNCH' The US State Department confirmed that an American citizen was killed in the Tuesday attack. Spindler, who was the chief executive officer and global managing director of I-DEV International, was, according to colleagues, having lunch at the Dusit Hotel when the attack happened. I-DEV is based at Metta, a space for entrepreneurs that is located at the 14 Riverside office complex in the Belgravia building’s sixth floor. The Metta Africa head of community, memberships and operations Essie Mwikali said there were 45 people at the space when the attack happened and accounted for everyone and confirmed the death of Spindler. Nailab chief executive Sam Gichuru eulogised Spindler as “a strong supporter of the Kenyan Tech Ecosystem.”   Football Kenya Federation Nick Mwendwa led tributes.
