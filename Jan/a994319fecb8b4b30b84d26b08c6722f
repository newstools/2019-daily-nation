Public schools have finally received cash for free education after several weeks of waiting. Kenya Secondary School Heads Association chairman Kahi Indimuli confirmed this on Tuesday, saying, â€œSchools can plan for their activities effectively." Several principals confirmed that they had received the government money which will enable them to pay suppliers as well as teaching and non-teaching staff. The National treasury released the cash last Friday, Sh30 billion to secondary schools and Sh6 billion for primary schools. Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said the cash was disbursed through the National Education Management System. Dr Kipsang noted that use of the Nemis to disburse the funds had improved accuracy and accountability and boosted enrolment.
