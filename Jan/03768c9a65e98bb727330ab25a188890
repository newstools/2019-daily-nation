MONTREAL Russia faced up to the possibility of renewed sporting sanctions on Tuesday when the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) confirmed the country had missed a December 31 deadline to hand over data from its anti-doping laboratory in Moscow. "I am bitterly disappointed that data extraction from the former Moscow Laboratory has not been completed by the date agreed," said Wada president Craig Reedie. Wada said the independent Compliance Review Committee (CRC) will now consider the next move in the long-running saga at a January 14-15 meeting.
