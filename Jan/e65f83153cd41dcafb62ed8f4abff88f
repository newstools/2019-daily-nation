A middle-aged woman was accosted and killed by unknown assailants in Naivasha on Sunday morning just a stone throw away from her house. The woman, a mother of twins, was heading to work in a nearby farm where she secured a job as a flower grader less than a month ago, according to her uncle Mr Vincent Ochieng. Her body was found dumped in a bush just 50 metres from her rented house near the busy Naivasha-Nakuru highway. "It's apparent she was raped before being killed [since her undergarments had been removed]," said a neighbour. Mr Ochieng said his niece left the house at around 5am and was shocked to learn of her sudden death. "I was alerted that a body of a middle-aged woman had been found by the roadside, little did I know it was that of my niece," said Mr Ochieng. A police officer at the scene told Nation that the woman was hit with a blunt object on the head. The body was taken to Naivasha Sub County Hospital mortuary as police start investigations.
