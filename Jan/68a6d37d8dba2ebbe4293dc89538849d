Two police officers are being held at the Mumias Police Station after they were arrested on Sunday trafficking outlawed brew. The two Administration Police officers identified as Harrison Kwambai and Meshack Musembi were driving a police vehicle in company of a businesswoman Tabitha Ngera when they were intercepted by traffic police who had mounted a roadblock at Mayoni shopping centre on Mumias-Busia Road. Mumias police chief Peter Kattam said 600 sachets of the illicit brew that was being ferried from Uganda were seized. "It's very unfortunate that officers who are supposed to fight trafficking of outlawed alcohol are abetting traders to transport the brew from the neighbouring country," said Mr Kattam. Mr Kattam said the brew was destined for Kakamega town. Mumias Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss Robert Mureithi said they waylaid the suspects after receiving a tip-off locals in Busia. "They became suspicious over goods that were being packed in a police vehicle at the border town and alerted us," said Mr Mureithi Mr Mureithi said the seized brew is worth at least Sh200, 000. He said the suspects will be arraigned on Monday.   Drama as 2 police formations almost open fire on each other.
