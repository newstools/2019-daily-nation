Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria’s claim that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s government has underperformed in the Mt Kenya region has sparked a political storm. A section of leaders accused him off being disrespectful, while others backed him, saying the country should adopt Majimbo (federal) system of government. Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata said Mr Kuria was hatching a political scheme to malign President Kenyatta’s regime. “Mr Kuria, aiming to be the next Kikuyu kingpin, wants to malign President Kenyatta so as to get the opportunity. He will not succeed in his mission,” Mr Kang’ata said. PROGRESS Mr Kang’ata noted that the government had improved infrastructure in his region, citing electricity connectivity and road construction in Kiharu constituency. “What the governments of presidents Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel arap Moi and Mwai Kibaki did in Kiharu cannot be compared to what the current leadership has done,” he said. Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wa Muchomba asked Mr Kuria to apologise to the President for disrespecting him. CENSUS This came even as Mr Kuria stood his ground that using biometrics in this year’s upcoming census would be the only way to get accurate data about the population. He said resource allocation should be based on the size of the population rather than the geographical region. Laikipia Woman Rep Catherine Waruguru said Mr Kuria only spoke his mind and should be allowed to express his views on issues. Imenti North MP Rahim Dawood also supported Mr Kuria, saying the Jubilee regime had underperformed in its political bedrock of Mt Kenya.
