Fidel Odinga’s life was celebrated and remembered Friday as the family of Raila Odinga marked the fourth anniversary of his death. In a memorial tribute, shared by his mother Ida Odinga on social media, the family said they remember Fidel as “a loving son, a protective brother, a doting father and loyal friend." "Today is always painful because once more it is a reminder that life is sometimes rough, although we were blessed with years with you. "Our time together will never be enough. We will always remember you with affection, warmth and love," reads the tribute. Fidel was found dead on January 4, 2015 at his home in Karen, Nairobi after a night out with friends. He was the eldest son in a family of four children Rosemary, Raila Junior and Winnie. His friends said they are planning a nationwide football tournament in his honour. The planers of the event dubbed ‘Fidel Odinga Cup’ include, Don Bosco Gichana, Hilary Alila, Robert Gichuru and Jeff Kiboro Mr Gichana said the team is also considering establishing of Fidel Odinga Foundation to help in community service “As Fidel’s friends, we have mooted the ideas to ensure his spirit lives forever in our hearts and in honour of our great friend,” Mr Gichana said. Mr Alila said the event will go a long way in recognising the achievements made by Fidel and to fulfil his dreams in sports and service to the people. “Fidel was a sportsman and a great sponsor of various development projects. As we mark his fourth anniversary, we want to demonstrate our friendship with him and ensure we accord him the respect he deserves,” added Mr Alila. Mr Gichana pointed out that they will reach out to major clubs including those in the Kenya Premier League to participate in the tournament.   For former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, January has over the years been a month of joy and disappointment.
