Western Stima coach Paul Ogai has slammed his forwards after being held to a 2-2 draw by Nzoia Sugar in a SportPesa Premier League clash at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu on Sunday. Vincent Odongo opened the scoring for the hosts in the 13th minute before Stephen Etiyang drew the visitors level seven minutes later. Goalkeeper Samuel Odhiambo restored Stima's lead from the spot in the 68th minute but Jackson Duang levelled with an expertly taken penalty with only nine minutes left. Speaking to Nation Sport post-match, an irate Ogai rued the missed chances by his strikers - Laban Gambareko and Herbert Kopany - that ultimately proved costly. “They (strikers) are failing the team, it's rather we use midfielders if they are the ones scoring. We can play with a false number nine because we have done it before,” said a visibly disappointed Ogai. "We have to make changes if the strikers cannot perform. We will do away with them so they should be prepared to watch the game from the terrace," vented Ogai as he also pointed out silly mistakes from his defenders, adding they have costed them maximum points against Bandari, Kariobangi Sharks and Nzoia Sugar. "Look at the goals we are conceding, they are gifts from the defenders," he observed. Stima, who returned to the top tier after winning the National Super League last season, have had a dream start to the 2018/19 campaign having picked 15 points from eight matches. The powermen, who are third on the log, have scored netted 10 goals and conceded seven so far. Winger Kennedy Otieno is the top scorer at Western Stima this season with two goals.
