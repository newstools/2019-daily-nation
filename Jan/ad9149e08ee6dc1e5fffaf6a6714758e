National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi’s clarification that it would be unconstitutional for MPs to increase their salaries is a welcome assurance to a rather sceptical public. And that role, as he rightly put it, belongs to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. However, it will be recalled that the SRC was vilified by the MPs last year for slashing their salaries. The public apprehension is understandable. One matter on which MPs have in the past quickly forgotten their party affiliations and other differences and voted unanimously is to raise their salaries and allowances. As a result, Kenyan MPs are some of the best remunerated in the world and it has absolutely nothing to do with exemplary performance or any special skills. ODM leader Raila Odinga has challenged the leadership of Parliament and the lawmakers to come clean on the matter by confirming that they are not plotting to reward themselves with higher pay. We fully agree with his sentiment that such a raise would be in bad taste with the national economy in dire straits. But even more importantly, it’s this obsession with higher pay that raises the pertinent question as to whether the MPs seek those positions to enrich themselves or to provide quality leadership. It’s encouraging to note that Mr Muturi has pledged that, should such a proposal go to the House, it will be rejected. This is a timely assurance that the Speaker can rest assured that the people will be keenly watching and will hold him accountable should the matter come up during the debate of an impending Bill and be endorsed. Indeed, the MPs should read the public mood and back off any plan to increase their remuneration and instead try to efficiently and selflessly perform their duties.
