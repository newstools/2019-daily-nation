Deputy President William Ruto has said the country's unity cannot be compromised regardless of who wins or loses in an election. Dr Ruto said the government will not sit back and watch as some individuals perpetrate divisions. "We do not have a place for this kind of retrogressive politics. Leaders must seek to enhance harmony, togetherness and development in Kenya," he said on Friday at his Sugoi home, in Uasin Gishu County, during a prayer meeting with religious leaders from North Rift region. CHURCH He said Kenyans must learn from history and forge a new beginning. "I invite the political class to refine their messages for the well-being of our country. We all want to forge one country. We have a past, which we have many lessons to draw from." Dr Ruto said religious leaders should work with the government in uniting Kenyans because they are conduits of change. He described the church as the glue that holds a nation together through prayer, which ingrains virtues like peace and love. "The church is an institution of harmony, deep faith and servant leadership that breeds oneness and a sense of belonging," he said. And urged all to avoid tribalism. PROGRESS Additionally, Bishop Maurice Anthony Crowley of Kitale Catholic Diocese said the church will continue engaging the government in finding appropriate ways of advancing the nation. "The future of this country depends so much on what our leaders do. We will work with the government to improve governance and foster development," Bishop Crowley said. Other leaders present were MPs Julius Melly (Tinderet), Cornelly Serem (Aldai), Caleb Kositany (Soy) and Oscar Sudi (Kapseret).   Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga camps threaten the ruling party's unity.
