Kenya is set to contest for a non-permanent membership slot of the United Nations Security Council scheduled for mid-2019. Winning the slot will enhance Kenyaâ€™s influence in international decision-making, particularly on matters of peace and security for the benefit of the nation and the region at large. The Cabinet has already approved the plan and a campaign strategy to lobby the members. If successful, this will give Kenya a pole position as it joins the five permanent members for two years in making key decisions.
