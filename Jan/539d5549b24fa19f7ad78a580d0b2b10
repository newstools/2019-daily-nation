Advocate Peter Wanyama will be a prosecution witness against Senior Counsel Tom Ojienda in a case involving payments made to the latter while acting for Mumias Sugar Company. Making the announcement Thursday, the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji said after analysing his statements, he decided to use Mr Wanyama as a State witness. Mr Wanyama becomes the second person to be lined up as a prosecution witness in the case, after Court of Appeal judge Prof Otieno Odek. In an advertisement Thursday, Mr Wanyama said he was invited by the Director of Criminal Investigations on December 29 to clarify some issues regarding a law firm— Prof Otieno Odek, Prof Ojienda & Wanyama Advocates—where they were partners. Prof Ojienda has stopped his prosecution, arguing that the DPP abused his powers in recommending the charges. While stopping the charges, Justice Chacha Mwita said he was satisfied that the petition raises substantive questions of law. The case will be mentioned on February 18, for further directions.   DPP Noordin Haji says Tom Ojienda's former partner, Justice Otieno Odek of Court of Appeal, to testify against him.
