Celebrated Kenyan striker Dennis “The Menace” Oliech will start from the bench as champions Gor Mahia face Mathare United in a SportPesa Premier League clash this afternoon at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani from 3pm. Oliech is making a comeback in the domestic league after over a decade plying in Qatar, France and Dubai. He joined K’Ogalo last week on a two-year deal. Gor coach Hassan Oktay has retained the team that brushed Chemelil Sugar aside in midweek. Peter Odhiambo starts in between the stick with captain Harun Shakava and Joash Onyango providing cover at the back. Ugandan import Shaffik Batambuze and Philemon Otieno occupy the left and right back positions in that order, as Ernest Wendo does the donkey work from the midfield. Francis Kahata and Boniface Omondi, who grabbed the second goal against Chemelil Sugar, start on the flanks. Rwandese Jacques Tuyisenge and Nicholas Kipkirui lead the frontline in search of goals. Should Oliech play, he will be facing his former employers, Mathare, for the first ever time since moving to Qatar 16 years ago. Both teams have previously met 21 times with Gor winning eight, Mathare four, while nine matches ended in a draw. Gor lineup: Peter Odhiambo (GK), Philemon Otieno, Shafik Batambuze, Harun Shakava, Joash Onyango, Ernest Wendo, Boniface Omondi, Francis Kahata, Jacques Tuyisenge, Nicholas Kipkirui, Lawrence Juma. Substitutes: Shaban Odhoji (GK), Pascal Ogweno, Wellington Ochieng’, Kenneth Muguna, Dennis Oliech, Erisa Ssekisambu, Samuel Onyango.   He has 37 goals in 77 appearances for Kenya.
