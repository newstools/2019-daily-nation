Joy was clearly palpable on former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale’s face as he finally reunited with his daughter who was one of the people’s trapped at DusitD2 building after a suspected terrorist attack. The former legislator had been waiting since Tuesday keeping vigil with other families as he anxiously waited for security officers to rescue his daughter. But it was not until 3.38am when she finally emerged from the building and reunited with her father before they quickly drove out of the scene. Mr Khalwale, speaking earlier, said that his daughter – whom he did not divulge her name – called him immediately the suspected terrorists started firing minutes after 3pm. “She called immediately the first gun shots were fired here. I was at JKIA and I drove here immediately. She kept on telling me that the shooting was getting closer and this got me worried. She works here but I cannot tell you with which company for security purposes,” said Mr Khalwale. He also divulged that sons of Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi and Vihiga County Woman Representative Beatrice Adagala were also caught up in the attack but had been rescued. “Mudavadi’s son was here but was evacuated at around 5pm while Ms Adagala’s son was rescued an hour later,” he said.   Security officers' advance comes after at least 50 people rescued from building on Wednesday morning.
