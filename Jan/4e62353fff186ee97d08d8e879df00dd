Police in Mtwapa seized fake Kenyan currency worth Sh6 million. Kilifi County Commander Fredrick Ochieng said the money was found in a house in Shanzu, but no arrest was made. He said police raided the house following a tip-off from the public. “The officers conducted a search and found fake currency in the denomination of Sh1000, which totalled to 6.67 million,” he said. The police boss said the owner of the house escaped. Chemicals used to process the money including glycerine and aluminium foil were seized in a vehicle parked outside the suspect’s house. The vehicle was towed to a police station.
