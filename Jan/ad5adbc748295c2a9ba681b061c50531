Police have been allowed to detain a National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) official for 30 days. Appearing before Senior Resident Magistrate Caroline Nzibe, officers from anti-terrorism police unit said they suspected that Mr Augustine Mulwa Musembi might have aided those who attacked DusitD2 Hotel complex on January 15, where 21 people were killed. The car, registration number KCN 240E - a Toyota Ractis, was used by the terrorists who attacked the hotel. The police later established that there was a different car with similar registration numbers in Kitengela, Kajiado County. FAKE NUMBER PLATE Ms Monicah Githaiga, an investigating officer, said one of the number plates was either fake or was issued fraudulently. State counsel Eddie Kaddebe told the court investigators wanted to find out how similar registration numbers were issued. He said the police need time to visit NTSA offices and investigate the procurement process and recover all the documents related to the production of the duplicate number plates. FACE CHARGES The prosecutor said it was necessary for investigators to find out the process of producing number plates and specifically, the production of both sets of the number plates in question. “The applicant needs time to consult the Kenya Revenue Authority and NTSA to ascertain the true owner of the motor vehicle KCN 340 E,” he said. The Prosecutor said should the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decide to charge Mr Musembi, he will be face charges of provision of property or services for commission of terrorist acts against the prevention of terrorism laws.   Area has since been cordoned off and motorists are advised to use alternative routes
