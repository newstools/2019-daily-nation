At least seven Administration Police officers from Marani in Kitutu Chache North, Kisii County have been summoned to record statements in connection to a Saturday night assault on a couple at Nyakiogiro village. Area OCPD Caleb Wekesa said the officers will be investigated after the couple, who were also arrested on claims of brewing illicit brew, filed a complaint. Mr Josphat Oira and his wife Damaris Oira sustained serious injuries when the officers raided their home. Villagers said the couple were dragged from their home and beaten up. Witnesses said Mr Oira was dragged naked to the police vehicle but his daughter rushed to the van and gave him clothes. On Monday, Mr Wekesa told the Nation that the matter has been taken up by officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. “Nobody will be spared if they are found culpable,” he said. Mr Wekesa said they are also investigating reports that the night operation was not documented. A relative of the assaulted couple, Mr Samuel Omwado, told the Nation the couple abandoned the illicit brew business several years ago. Mr Omwado claimed the officers were settling an old score. Mr Omwando said the suspect had sued one of the officers over a similar night raid in his home because they destroyed his property. “This is the third time the officers are visiting his house at night without any authorisation from the court. This act of police terrorising villagers at night should stop,” Mr Omwando said. The OCPD said the couple were taken to hospital as investigations continue.
