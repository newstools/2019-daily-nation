The standoff between the University of Nairobi and Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed over the appointment of deputy vice-chancellors is not only embarrassing, but also gratuitous. It is even more incomprehensible that there could be a dispute about who should, or should not, serve as a DVC because the qualifications for the posts are clear in the Universities Act and the procedure for appointment laid out. Members of the University of Nairobi Council must have thought they were carrying out a routine task of shortlisting and interviewing individuals for the positions early this month but, as it turned out last week, they have to wait for the Attorney-General to endorse or disqualify the nominees. This is after Ms Mohamed substituted three of the names recommended by the council with those of others who, apparently, did not fare as well in the interviews. As would be expected, the council rejected the names and sought the AGâ€™s advice. GRADES The dispute mirrors another one in which the CS lowered the entry qualifications to teacher training colleges for students from the northeastern region. The Teachers Service Commission rejected the move and the matter is now the subject of litigation in the high court. While it is sensible to refer such disputes to the justice system, it is certainly curious and out of character that institutions under a single ministry can so bitterly disagree on average standard-issue matters that the courts must come in. The UoN is operating without four DVCs while the fate of 3,265 teacher trainees admitted to the colleges with lower grades is in limbo. The CS owes it to Kenyans to protect the image of the education system and inspire public confidence in her leadership.
