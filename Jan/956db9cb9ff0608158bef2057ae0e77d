Whatever Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko says, with several recent resignations of members of his Cabinet, the city county leadership is in a crisis. The latest to exit is Education Executive Janet Muthoni-Ouko, whom Governor Sonko ironically praises for having done a good job in the docket. As a result of the resignations, several key portfolios have been left without stewardship at a time when there is increasing demand for the city county to provide adequate services to its residents. But perhaps the most significant departure was that of technocrat Polycarp Igathe, as Deputy Governor. IGATHE It will be recalled that Mr Igathe, who left City Hall in January last year, had been tapped to complement politician Sonko’s apparent lack of managerial experience and provide the expertise to steer this most complex county, being the national capital. Mr Igathe left saying he had failed to win his boss’s confidence. Mr Sonko has been promising to unveil his choice new deputy and will, hopefully, do so today. The governor has tried to put on a brave face, reminding his critics that he has his unique style of managing affairs and that he won’t tolerate his juniors who get involved in graft. SERVICES He has warned that nothing will stand in his way as he goes about delivering services to residents. That is laudable. But with the frequent changes, reliable service delivery remains elusive. As the fights rage on, sticking out like a sore thumb is the silence of both the opposition and ruling party members of the city county assembly. Part of their role is oversight over the executive, and it’s quite surprising that they do not seem bothered about the raging crisis. The governor should put his house in order and let his officers do their work.
