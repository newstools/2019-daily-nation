The Supreme Court on Thursday overturned a Court of Appeal ruling allowing three Muslim students to wear hijabs in school. The students were suspended in 2014 by St Paul's Kiwanjani Secondary School in Isiolo for wearing the head covering worn by Muslim women. The school is sponsored by the Methodist Church of Kenya. In a triumph for the Methodist Church, the Supreme Court in a majority decision said the ruling by the Appellate court allowing the students — who have since completed high school education — was against the school uniform policy. The judges ruled that every school has a right to determine its rules. A parent had complained about the suspension but the High Court sided with the school. More follows.
