Form One reporting ended on Friday with the ministry of education effecting up to 106,000 transfers of students to their schools of choice. According to Education cabinet secretary Amina Mohammed, the transfers were affected by the ministry after school principals made the requests on behalf of students through the National Education Management Information System (Nemis). The reporting exercise started two weeks ago, on January 5 and was scheduled to end by January 11. However, the CS announced a one week extension after realising that over 300,000 students were yet to report to their selected schools. During the weekend, officials manning the online admission system were compiling data of students who reported to secondary schools this year. STRICTNESS At Starehe Boys Centre, a student was rejected by the school after failing to fill a mandatory document. His parents, Mr David Babu and the wife, Ms Christine Ngare from Isiolo, had to stay in a hotel for 10 days waiting for their son to be admitted. This was despite them having a letter that they had downloaded through Nemis. The ministry is set to handle the matter after the school ruled out the possibility of admitting the student, saying that his parents were rude. This year, the ministry had put strict measures to ensure that all students were only admitted through the online system. Students who did not get their admission letters through the online process were forced to join the schools they had been selected to join by the ministry. Those that wanted transfers had to seek the ministryâ€™s approval through the principals of their choice schools. Earlier, there were reports that CS Mohamed had rescinded the decision on online-based admission and allowed principals to admit students. However, this turned out to be false.   Some candidates are yet to be admitted to any secondary school.
