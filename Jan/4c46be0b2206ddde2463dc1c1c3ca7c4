Tharaka-Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki has told off his colleagues who are unhappy with the recent Council of Governors' (CoG) elections. Speaking at Mbiroini village in Maara Constituency during launch of a road improvement project, Mr Njuki said those who lost must accept defeat, support their elected colleagues and try their luck next time. "Those who lost have the only option of accepting defeat and having a handshake with those who were elected," said Mr Njuki. He said the previous CoG leadership did very little to address their issues including making sure that counties got money at the right time. CONFIDENCE Mr Njuki, who was elected the CoG Agriculture committee chairman, expressed confidence in the new team, arguing that it is going to promote devolution. He said as the Agriculture committee chairman, he will endeavour to promote the sector that squarely falls under devolved governments. He encouraged the formation of regional economic blocks noting that it is the only solution to meaningful development. 2022 ELECTIONS He insisted that the recent governors’ council election was a clear indication of what will happen during the 2022 General Election where, he said, Kenyans will go for leaders who can deliver and not based on where they come from. Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya criticised the CoG after it ignored a deal made in 2017 to have him succeed former chairman, Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok. The gentleman’s agreement stipulated that Mr Mvurya would take over form the Turkana governor after six months and be deputised by Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. But the CoG on Monday ignored the agreement that had been made public and conducted elections in which Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya clinched the chairmanship and will be deputised by Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria.   Governor says council ignored deal reached in 2017 to have him succeed Josphat Nanok.
