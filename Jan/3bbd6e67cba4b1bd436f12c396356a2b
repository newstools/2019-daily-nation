Kenyan champions Gor Mahia on Sunday held New Stars de Douala to a barren draw in Limbe, Cameroon to qualify for the Caf Confederation Cup group stages. Gor had edged out the Cameroonians 2-1 in the first leg of the play at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani and needed to avoid a defeat or earn a draw of any kind at Limbe's Omnisports Stadium in the reverse fixture. This is Gor Mahia's second successive participation in the lucrative group stage after dropping down in the second tier after elimination from Caf Champions League. Gor gave a brave fight in the match attended by a handful of New Stars fans. The hosts would blame themselves for wasting numerous scoring chances especially in the final quarter. The draw for the last 16 will be held on Monday in Cairo, Egypt. More to follow...
