Home player Joseph Waigwa needed only a birdie and seven pars, to share the round one lead with Mombasa Golf Club’s Lawrence Odhiambo in the Qatar Airways sponsored Captain’s Prize golf tournament at the par 71 Nyali Golf and Country Club course Mombasa on Saturday. Starting with a par at the par five-first hole, Waigwa playing off handicap 12, dropped three back-to-back shots thereafter parred seven and eight and finished with a bogey at the ninth for six over par in the outward nine. He however managed to record four pars at the back nine with a birdie at the par five-17th, for two over par and the day’s 68 nett to tie with the handicap 24 Odhiambo who birdied the straight par 16th in addition to a number of pars, to also wind up the day on 68. Following the two leaders very closely was former Nyali captain Abbas Sheikh with nett 70. Sheikh got off to a flying start, firing in a birdie putt at the first though he bogeyed three straight holes thereafter. He had a tough back nine where he only managed one par. Five others were tied on 71 nett half way through the first round which saw a big field of 202 players teeing off. Leading this group was former Nyanza Golf Club captain Evans Manono who like Sheikh, started with a birdie at the first, picked another one at the third though it was at the back nine where he made five pars. Others also in 71 were Ian Marshall, Inayet Kudrati, Bharat Chavda of Mombasa Golf, and Suresh Hirani. Half of the field including all the ladies were still on the course battling it out in the colourful event which brings to an end club captain Taib Bajaber’s term of office. The second and final round will take place Sunday morning. Besides the title sponsors Qatar Airways, the event has also attracted the support of other sponsors such as Kitui Flour Mills, Simba Colt who have offered a Mitsubishi ASX worth Sh3.8 million as a special prize for any player firing in one at the 172-yard par three-18th hole.
