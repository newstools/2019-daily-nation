2016 Africa Junior Cross Country champion Miriam Cherop won a hotly contested Athletic Kenya’s (AK) 10 kilometres senior women's race in Bomet County on Saturday. Cherop, who climbed up the ladder from junior to senior category, clocked 32:56.1 to finish first in the competition held in Sotik town under sunny conditions. “I was well prepared for the competition so I did not burn so much energy to lead from the start to the end. I am looking forward to competing in the regional event,” said Cherop who trains at Silibwet Athletics club in Bomet Central Sub-county. Mercy Cherono - the 2014 5,000 metres Commonwealth champion - who was competing for the first time after her maternity leave, made it to the county team after emerging sixth in 34:33:0. “This is my first competition coming from maternity leave and I did not perform as per my expectations. I am far from regaining my shape though I've made good progress,” said Cherono. Julius Tanki, winner of the Machakos leg of the AK cross country series, won the men's 10km race in a time of 28:18.0 while Isaac Kemboi from Sotik came second in 28:35.1. In the six kilometres junior women's race, Emmaculate Anyango led the pack in a time of 19:33.0 while Selestine Chepkirui was ranked second in 19:41.0. Edwin Koskei Kiplangat clocked 22:03.0 to win the eight kilometres junior men's race with Leonard Bett emerging second in a time of 22:07.2. “We have a strong team going to the South Rift regional competition in Kericho County on February 9 which will bring together athletes from Bomet, Kericho, Laikipia, Narok and Nakuru Counties,” said John Kimetto, the AK Bomet Branch Chairman.
