Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet on Monday reshuffled police commanders in the country as part of ongoing reforms in the service. Six women were among the new police bosses unveiled at Flamingo Hotel in Mombasa during a security meeting that Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i also attended. Also named was Jackson Tumwet who will be head of operations in Nairobi with regional boss Philip Ndolo acting as the police commander. Mr Ndolo is the Nairobi regional police commander. “We are going to have 46 commanders. We don’t have a county commander for Nairobi because the regional commander is the county commander. That has been the tradition over the years,” said IG Boinnet. WOMEN The six female county police commanders are Naomi Ichami (Bomet), Leah Ngutu (Kirinyaga), Catherine Mugwe (Nyamira), Lydia Ligami (Kitui), Beatrice Gachago (Kajiado) and Esther Seroney (Homa Bay). In his speech, Dr Matiangi’i said they were committed to “hunting” for more women for top slots. Mombasa and Kwale police commanders Johnston Ipara and Tom Odero retained their positions. Those affected in the region include Fredrick Ochieng who has been moved from Kilifi to Tana River and his office taken by Mr Patrick Okeri. Mr Perminus Nyaga is the new county commander for Lamu, having replaced Muchangi Kioi who was not in the new list. The new Taita Taveta County commander is Saidi Mohamed who replaced Halima Abdi whose fate is also unknown.   Others have been promoted and appointed as deputy regional bosses.
