Other than being a source of livelihood, sports is also important in fostering national unity. In the spirit of sportsmanship, players from opposing teams usually embrace and shake hands after matches. Sports also inculcates friendship. When national teams compete under the Kenyan flag and win tournaments, the nation takes pride in their achievements. But victory should not be pursued at any cost, least of all through hooliganism. And whenever acts of hooliganism are witnessed in sports, they should be dealt with firmly to deter a recurrence. Worryingly, hooliganism is slowly rearing its head in the Kenyan Premier League. On January 6, during one such football match between AFC Leopards and Nzoia Sugar at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos, goons in team jerseys were captured on camera roughing up the match referee. Apparently angered by a last-minute equaliser from Nzoia to make the score 1-1, they attacked the official at the final whistle. There are mechanisms of dealing with match disputes, which aggrieved parties should pursue, but not resorting to violence. Sadly, such incidents are becoming common. Last August 25, irate fans uprooted seats at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, following Leopards’ 2-0 defeat to Gor Mahia. In 2010, a stampede at Nyayo National Stadium during a KPL match between Gor and Leopards left seven fans dead. There have been many acts of hooliganism since then. Hooligans must not be allowed to take over football as they discourage genuine fans from attending matches and scare away potential sponsors. Football Kenya Federation must decisively deal with the problem for “the beautiful game” to become the popular family outing that it is meant to be.
