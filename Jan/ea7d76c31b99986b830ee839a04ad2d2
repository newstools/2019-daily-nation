Starehe Boys Centre has bowed to pressure from the Ministry of Education and agreed to have a board of management (BoM) whose secretary will be the centre principal. The 10-member board will be chaired by David Mureithi with Mr Peter Masaku, the principal in line with the Basic Education Act 2013, as the secretary. “This week we have made important steps in normalising relationships with the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) and the Ministry of Education," said acting director Josephat Mwaura. "Our management committee was formally inaugurated as the BoM. This should open the way for engagement with the TSC and the MoE for further support on matters such as infrastructure grants that other schools get." THREATS The commission had threatened to withdraw all teachers from the school while the ministry had threatened to suspend funding over its failure to adhere to the law. The TSC had protested that the centre board appointment had not been regularised as per the law, making it difficult for the principal to discharge his duties as stipulated in his letter of appointment. The centre will continue to receive funding from the TSC, including capitation for free day secondary education for students as well as teachers. TARGET Mr Mwaura called on those who support the institution to double their efforts to ensure its turnaround. “We have to raise at least Sh400 million to hit our target of Sh600 million for the Griffin Memorial Endowment Trust Fund," he said. Other members of the board are Josphat Mwaura, Sarah  Itukuh, Jarret Odwallo, Muratha Kinuthia, Isabella Musyoka, Raymond Romo, Mohamed Wahliye and Sr Jane Soita. However, the centre had insisted that the inauguration of the board be done under the Starehe constitution instead of Ministry of Education guidelines.   Renown school needs Sh85 million for fees of some 600 needy students.
