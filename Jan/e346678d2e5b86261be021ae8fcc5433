Suppliers and contractors demanding Sh100 billion from the county governments await the verification of their claims by the Auditor-General’s office within the next one month. This follows the end of a 10-day notice by the government to suppliers and contractors to file documents for claims arising before June 2018 with their respective county executive members in charge of finance to facilitate processing of their payments. In a notice in the dailies, the Auditor-General’s office said it had received instructions from the National Treasury to ‘urgently’ verify the claims and report back by the end of January. The move follows a quiet but decisive move by the contractors and suppliers demanding bank guarantees for all contracts received before taking up any job at the county governments. Private businesses Some counties have become notorious for seeking services and receiving goods, but not so keen to pay for them. The Auditor-General’s notice said that each claim must be accompanied by documents notifying the private businesses of the contract award, their letters of acceptance, and commencement of works. Other requirements are the local purchase orders, local service orders, contract documents, delivery notes, goods delivery notes and the service delivery notes. The payments delays have seen some contractors’ properties auctioned and banks declining to advance credit to small and medium enterprises.   Contractors and suppliers owed over Sh100 billion by county governments could finally get paid after the National Treasury waded into the pending bills issue.
