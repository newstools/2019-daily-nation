This year’s Extreme Sports Limited tournaments will incorporate a capacity building initiative aimed at sensitizing all participating clubs on dangers of radicalization and how to ultimately protect local communities from violent extremism. With their Nairobi-based affiliate partners, Excellence Integrity & Growth Consultants (EIG), Metro Sports together with Altaawon Educational Centre (AEC), the 15-year-old professional sports company is planning to bring on board more companies to support their programmes. While addressing journalists in Nairobi yesterday, Extreme Sports chief executive officer Hussein Mohammed called on more corporate bodies to support their initiative to protect young people from joining extremist groups like Al Shabaab. “With the help of parents, family networks, social workers and teachers together with relevant stakeholders we shall offer counselling and mentoring services through workshops for young people at risk,” he added. “Our target in initial phase is to disseminate this critical information to at least 2,500 of our players within Nairobi County. This initiative remains true to our original agenda when we incorporated Super 8 activities 15 years ago.”
