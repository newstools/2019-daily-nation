Harambee Stars coach Sebastien Migne has said he was impressed with legendary striker Dennis Oliech’s display on his Gor Mahia debut during their 1-1 draw against Mathare United on Sunday at Kasarani stadium. Oliech, 33, came off the bench on 68 minutes to show glimpse of brilliance but it wasn’t enough to grab a memorable goal on his return to top flight football after over a decade. Migne, who watched the former Stars captain from the stands, has challenged him to deliver on the pitch for a chance to return to the national team. “It was interesting but he needs to rediscover his match fitness,” Migne told Nation Sport on Monday. “For now he needs to concentrate at his club and score goals then we shall see. At the moment he is far from the high level, but the Cup of Nations is six months away, you never know in football,” added the 46-year-old Frenchman, who guided Stars’ return to the continental showpiece after 15 years. Coincidentally, it’s Oliech’s goal against Cape Verde in July 2003 that helped Kenya appear at the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia. “Normally I do not have the answers, the back stops with the player. I will monitor all players in the league to get probable names who can compete for positions in the national team,” revealed Migne. Oliech, who has 37 goals in 77 Harambee Stars appearances, said his focus is on helping Gor retain the title by scoring more than 20 goals this season.   "His finishing in training is fantastic," said Oktay of Oliech.
