Former Gor Mahia coach Dylan Kerr has said he is happy to have joined South African Premier Soccer League (PSL) side Black Leopards. Kerr joined Leopards in November last year after a 16-month reign at Gor where he won two league titles - recording 51 wins in 79 matches he was in charge. Kerr, who turned 52 on January 14, was named the PSL Coach of the Month for January on Wednesday following Leopards’ impressive show of three wins and a draw in the league from mid-December to January. His Zambian striker Mwape Musonda, who tops the PSL scoring charts with eight goals, emerged the best player in the month. “When I first came to Black Leopards, people were saying I was crazy and I’m making a mistake for joining the club, but this proves that it was the right decision on my part,” Kerr was quoted as saying by South African portal, Kickoff. Kerr, who replaced Joel Masutha in November, has guided the club to 12th in the 16-team standings with 20 points from 17 games. “What I’m trying to tell everybody at the club is that we want to keep focus and keep our feet as firmly on the ground as possible,” he added. Leopards visit Bloemfontein Celtic in their next league match on Sunday.
