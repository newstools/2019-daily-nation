Athletics Kenya (AK) executives recently announced they would register both local and foreign coaches starting from next Wednesday. The track and field governing officials also said they would take action against individuals or groups haphazardly organising unsanctioned road races. AK maintain that these decisions are purely meant to bring sanity into the sport and to, inter alia, guard against the use of banned performance-enhancing substances in Kenyan athletics and the exploitation of runners. These decisions are laudable, given that Kenya is still on the anti-doping watch-list of global organisations, including the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Cases of mistreatment of athletes and the mushrooming of athletics camps manned by unqualified personnel abound, and it is important to inject sobriety into the management of the sport. Athletesâ€™ representatives, managers and coaches form an integral part in the fight against the doping menace, hence the need to regulate their operations. Through proper registration and tighter immigration controls, it will be easy to identify which management teams or individuals abet doping and punish them accordingly. Equally, it is important to regulate road races that continue to mushroom countrywide as some of these end up not paying out prize money to winners and fail to employ mandatory anti-doping controls. It would be prudent for athletes to have a list of sanctioned road races and other athletics competitions at the start of each season so that they can confidently plan to compete and expect to rightfully earn prize money should they do well.
