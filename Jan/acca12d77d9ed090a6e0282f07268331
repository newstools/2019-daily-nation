A woman who survived the Westgate terror attack about five years ago also miraculously came out of a deadly attack at DusitD2 complex alive Tuesday. Tracy Wanjiru said the last thing she expected when she went to work Tuesday morning was that she would be caught up in another terror attack. Ms Wanjiru 28, a manager at a salon in the complex, was in September 2013 at the Westgate mall when Al-Shabaab militants stormed in. She was six months pregnant at the time. Her experience surviving the 2013 attack, informed her decisions while responding to the Dusit attack. A few minutes past 3pm, she heard the first shots followed by a loud explosion. Ms Wanjiru said she immediately sprang into action, alerting her colleagues that they were under attack. They took cover and she used her Facebook page to ask for help.       Mr Leonard Kamau daringly went into the building to rescue his sister.
