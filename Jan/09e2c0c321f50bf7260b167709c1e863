Police have told politicians and members of the public to keep off 14 Riverside Drive and Dusit D2 Hotel area until the security operation is over. In a statement, the police said the area is still a crime scene and under active security operation. “Until it is declared safe, everyone not actively involved in the operation should avoid the area,” said the police. The police issued the warning as explosions and heavy gunfire were still being heard on Wednesday at about 6.00am, and later at 9am, as security officers engaged suspected terrorists inside Grosvenor Hotel in the Dusit office complex. One more person was rescued from the building at about 9am and reunited with her family members who had been waiting outside for hours. But the police statement seems to contradict the Ministry of Interior that had earlier tweeted that: “No further threat to public exists.” “Mopping up process still underway. No further threat to public exists. Civilians who had been secured in one building by security while mopping up continues now safely evacuated. All buildings and surrounding area secure,” said the Ministry of Interior. Meanwhile, the police have appealed to member of the public who are tracing their beloved one to use the official tracing hotline numbers: 0715 820219 and 1199.   Security officers' advance comes after at least 50 people rescued from building on Wednesday morning.
