Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has faulted members of the county assembly for what he says is failing to properly manage ward bursary funds. Speaking at a public forum in Hola on Thursday, the governor said the administration had gone out of its way to increase the bursary funds in wards from Sh5 million to Sh10 million in order to help all needy students an effort that is since proving futile. "As an administration we have been left with nothing; we have given each ward Sh10 million. Now I fail to understand how we still have reports of students dropping out of school for lack of school fees," he said. SHAMEFUL Mr Godhana termed the situation in the wards as shameful, calling on the MCAs to explain to the residents why they are missing out on the bursaries. The governor also said it is sad to hear reports of children walking in search of school fees while others have dropped out. The governor accused the MCAs of hypocy for failing to take responsibility in the management of resources given to them thus forcing the county administration to stretch itself further in order to assist the needy students through an emergency kitty. DEMAND BURSARIES He called on residents to go to their MCAsâ€™ offices and demand for the bursaries. Mr Godhana's sentiments come barely three days after the Daily Nation published the story of a girl, Juliana Koshi, who walked for 15 kilometres pleading with well-wishers for school fees. A case is also told of a girl from Kipini Ward who was forced into marriage after failing to raise fees for her secondary school education even after numerous attempts to get bursary assistant from her MCA.   Juliana Koshi hopes to raise Sh53,554 for her fees and Sh20,300 for other personal items
