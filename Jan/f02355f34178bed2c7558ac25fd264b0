President Uhuru Kenyatta has cautioned Cabinet secretaries against engaging in politicking. Speaking at Kitengela, Kajiado County, on Thursday while on his way to Tanzania for the East Africa Community Summit, Mr Kenyatta said it will not be business as usual for such Cabinet secretaries. "During today's Cabinet meeting I reminded our Cabinet secretaries that there are many young Kenyans who are willing and ready to work if they felt they are not up to task. "Those who have chosen to keep politicking instead of serving the people should be ready to give way," President Kenyatta said. DEVELOPMENT Mr Kenyatta said his administration is keen on fulfilling the promises made during the last General Election campaigns as the country fosters peace and unity, which are necessary for development. He said his truce with ODM boss Raila Odinga is his way of showing Kenyans how peace can be arrived at. On his part, Deputy President William Ruto supported the Presidentâ€™s call for Kenyans to disengage from unnecessary politicking and focus on development. Mr Ruto urged Kenyans and all leaders to rally behind the campaign against corruption. "We need to decide as Kenyans that we will live together peacefully and work together to develop our nation as well as the region. Politics alone cannot feed us, we will be fed by our hard work," he said.   Deputy President William Ruto says he is ready for a lifestyle audit.
