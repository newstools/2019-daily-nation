The first delegation from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) is already in the country to assess progress made by Kenya ahead of the 2020 World Under-20 Championships to be held in Nairobi. Athletics Kenya (AK) Public Relations Officer Evans Bosire disclosed that the team of 14 will have day-long meetings on Wednesday and Thursday with the Ministry of Sports and the federation. The IAAF Council's session on July 26 in Buenos Aires, Argentina picked Nairobi, Kenya as the host city of the next World Athletics Under-20 Championships slated for July 7-12, 2020. The delegation that arrived in batches on Monday and Tuesday, include IAAF's Head of Event Operations Toni Jorba, Executive Director of Communications Jackie Brock-Doyle, and Chief Information Officer Dang Duy along with technical delegates Gemma Castano and Imre Matrahaz. Others are IAAF Platforms and Distribution Operations Manager Frederick Sanchez, Mark Fulton, who is the Executive Producer for IAAF Productions and the IAAF's Head of Competitions Luis Saladie. The IAAF delegation will hold meetings with the Cabinet Secretary for Sports Rashid Echesa, Principal Secretary Kirimi Kaberia, and AK executive, led by President Jackson Tuwei. "This visit is extremely important for Kenya and will effectively kick off an extremely important leg of our preparations to host yet another successful global competition," said Tuwei. Bosire indicated that the delegation will also address a press conference touching on their visit at a time and location to be confirmed in due course. Kenya won the bid to host the World Under-20 Championships following a largely successfully World Under-18 Championships held in 2017 with a record turnout of over 60,000 fans attending the event at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. The visit by the IAAF delegates also follows several local meetings by the event’s secretariat. “We have held several meetings just to strategise,” said Tuwei.
