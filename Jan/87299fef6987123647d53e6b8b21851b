Former Youth Enterprise Development Fund board chairman and music producer Bruce Odhiambo has died. Mr Odhiambo died on Monday night while in hospital where he had been since Saturday, according to a source close to his family. "Very sad about the passing of my friend Bruce Odhiambo. In the last three months, he remained strong even as his sick heart failed him. It was sad to watch him suffer. I will cherish the many moments we spent together. We have lost a good man and one of the most creative minds," Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. Mr Mutua had earlier posted on his Twitter handle that he had visited him at the Nairobi. "You were front and centre when we created@RadioJamboKenyain 2008. I'll remember you for your contribution to Kenya's music industry. Rest in peace Bruce Odhiambo," said Ms Radull on Twitter following reports of Mr Odhiambo's death. President Uhuru Kenyatta picked Mr Odhiambo to chair the Youth Fund's board in 2014 after revoking the appointment of Gor Evans Semelangâ€™o.
