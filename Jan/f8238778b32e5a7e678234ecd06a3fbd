Hi Brenda, I was recently cat-fished by a girl I met on Tinder. Her profile photo was hot and we got to chatting, but when we eventually had a face to face meeting, I was shocked to find out that she looked nothing like her profile on Tinder. At first I thought she may have used too many filters on her profile. However, upon taking a closer look, I realised she was a completely different person. She was plain-looking and I could not get past the fact that she had lied to me. My friends think I judged her too hastily and should instead get to know her. Please advise.  Hi, Your friends are wrong. Run. There is literally a whole show based on these kinds of things – people lying to other people online and learning the hard way that trust is the most basic part of a relationship, before even love. What else is she lying about? Is that even her? What's her real name? And are you going to automatically question everything that comes from her mouth because I mean obviously you can't be sure if it is true...particularly if she was bold enough to still meet you even after she knew well and good that the picture on Tinder would not be the one showing up on the date. Flee, I tell you! This isn’t a red flag, it's a bright red tarpaulin. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   There are a lot of problems with this problem.
