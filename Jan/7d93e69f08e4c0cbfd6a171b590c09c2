A 60-year-old woman has died after fire destroyed a makuti-thatched house in Likoni, Mombasa. Madongani village elder, Bakari Juma Kandi’s wife was burnt beyond recognition in the Wednesday night inferno. Mr Kandi told the Nation during his wife’s burial on Thursday afternoon that he was rescued by youths through the window. The elder, who sustained burns on his head, legs, face and back during the incident, was rushed to Likoni Sub County Hospital where he was treated and discharged. According to eye witnesses, nothing was salvaged from the six-roomed house. Mr Kandi said he heard his wife screaming in the next room and when he woke up, he could not see the roof due to thick smoke and huge flames of fire. "I talked to my wife yesterday (Wednesday) from 10pm to 11pm before we bid each other goodnight as we slept in different rooms," said Mr Kandi. The fire, which gutted down the all household items, lasted two hours. Senior Likoni village elder Mzee Seif Manuar appealed to well-wishers to support the family to put up a new home and buy new household items.
