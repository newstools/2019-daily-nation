A satiated Kenya Sevens head coach Paul Murunga hopes his players will carry their newly found confidence into Sydney Sevens this weekend in Australia. Murunga wants his charges to build up on their performance from Hamilton Sevens, New Zealand last weekend where they reached the Challenge Trophy final for a main Cup show in Sydney. Kenya opens their Sydney quest against Canada at 1.44am on Saturday before meeting USA at 7.34am in their Pool “B” outing before wrapping up against France at 11.17am. They’ll be hoping to win at least two of these matches to stand a solid chance of getting their first Main Cup quarterfinal action of the season. Mike Friday’s USA have reached the Cup final of the last three legs in Dubai, Cape and Hamilton but failed to win any Cup. They lost to New Zealand 21-5 in the final in Dubai before going down to Fiji 29-15 and 38-0 in Cape Town and Sydney respectively. “It has been a good build up for my young side from not winning a single match in Dubai to claiming two victories in Cape Town and three in Sydney where we got seven points,” said Murunga.“It gets better as we grow I confidence and focus on getting better results.” Murunga said victory against their higher ranked opponents in Sydney will be a big boost to them. “I am glad that we have improved on attack and defence and Jacob Ojee’s leadership is great,” said Murunga. USA are placed second in the Series though they tie with Fiji, who are the Sydney defending champions, on 57 points each. Canada and France are placed 11th and 12th with 20 and 14 points respectively followed by Kenya in 13th with 11 points.
