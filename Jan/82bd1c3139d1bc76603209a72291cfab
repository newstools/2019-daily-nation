Shock and grief gripped residents of Kalyet village in Elburgon, Nakuru County, after a 30-year-old man brutally killed his father, apparently in a quarrel over a Sh100. Assistant Chief Harun Koima, who confirmed the bizarre incident, said Mr Wilson Chepkicho Yegon, 65, died on the spot after his son Eric Kibiwot hit him on the head with an axe. The incident occurred at around 8 pm on Monday. According to the administrator, Kibiwot had requested for Sh200 from his father at around midday on Monday, but the elderly man could only afford to give him Sh100, proceeds from his milk business. "Mr Kibiwot went drinking with the money. He arrived home at around 8pm while drunk and demanded for a balance of Sh100 from his father before a scuffle ensued. The son attacked his father after he said he did not have another Sh100 to give him,” said Mr Koima. The suspect fled into a nearby forest immediately after the incident. The administrator said police have launched a manhunt to arrest the assailant. "The suspect is still at large but police are pursuing him," said Mr Koima. The dead man’s body was taken to the Elburgon Sub-County Hospital mortuary.
