IN DAR ES SALAAM AFC Leopards contingent was on Thursday morning still holed up at the Nefaland hotel in Magomoeni, here in Dar, with the players, technical bench and officials awaiting the verdict of a protest filed against Tanzania's Simba. Leopards lost 2-1 to Simba in a pulsating quarter-final encounter of the SportPesa Cup at the National Stadium on Wednesday evening but the Kenyan club filed a protest demanding the victors be disqualified from the tournament for fielding "an ineligible player." The player in question is one Lamine Moro, a Ghanaian international who featured in that match as a central defender alongside Ivorian Pascal Wawa. Leopards insist he has a valid contract with top Zambian side Buildcon. "I don't think Simba are more special compared to all the other teams featuring in this tournament," said Saul Shyder, a Leopards official and team's Chef de Mission. "He (Moro) is a Buildcon player and we have evidence, we filed a protest at half-time (during the match) so it is up to the Tanzanian Football Federation and tournament organisers to dispense justice." At the same time, Nation Sport has established eliminated Gor Mahia left Dar on Thursday morning and were due in Nairobi at around midday. The Kenyan champions have won the last two editions of this tournament but were shocked 4-3 on post-match penalties by lowly Mbao on Wednesday in a clash that also had coach Hassan Oktay sent off. The teams had tied 1-1 in regular time. Bandari and Kariobangi Sharks are the Kenyan teams remaining in this tournament and both have qualified for the semis set to be contested on Friday. Bandari are scheduled to face Simba or Leopards depending on the outcome of the verdict, while Sharks will tackle Mbao for a place in the tournament's decider. The winning team will pocket Sh3 million and also be handed an opportunity to face English Premier League side Everton.   Gor Mahia are out of the SportPesa Cup.
