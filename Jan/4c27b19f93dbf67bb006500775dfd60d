During debate in a special sitting on Friday, members of county assembly demanded that project work begin immediately and that contractors and suppliers be paid on time. “We have about four months left before the financial year ends so the executive must move fast to implement projects, especially those on infrastructure, before the onset of the long rains in March,” budget committee chairperson Kiiru Gachomba said during the meeting convened by speaker Wahome Ndegwa. The finance executive assured the ward representatives that the money will be put to good use and that none will returned to the National Treasury.   Some MCAs say they are united, while others say they are dissatisfied with leadership.
