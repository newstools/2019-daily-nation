Police were forced to lob teargas canisters to disperse a section of protesting Gor Mahia fans during the SportPesa Premier League match against KCB at Kenyatta stadium in Machakos. The fans hurled objects on the pitch on 89th minute after first assistant referee Gilbert Cheruiyot awarded KCB a throw in that infuriated an already irritated section of Gor Mahia fans. Gor was already trailing by a solitary goal as the clock ticked towards the final whistle. Both players have assembled inside the pitch waiting for calm to be restored. No injury has been reported so far as police engaged the fans in a running battle inside the stadium. The match may likely be called off by match referee. Referee Raymond Omondi resumed the match with Gor missing a chance to draw level at the death after Dennis Oliech shot from the area was punched by KCB goalkeeper Zamu Adisa before an outstanding Mike Kibwage cleared his lines. Omondi blew the final whistle three minutes later as both teams walked to their respective dressing rooms after hurdling together for prayer.
