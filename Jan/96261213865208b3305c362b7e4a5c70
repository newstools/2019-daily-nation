Haki Africa, a human rights lobby group, has condemned the Tuesday’s killing of a suspected criminal by police in Kisauni Constituency, Mombasa. Haki Africa’s rapid response officer Mathias Shipeta said the organisation had communicated with the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution to follow up the matter. “We call on the police to exercise restraint in dealing with security issues. We have already filed a complaint with the IPOA and we will follow up the matter to ensure there is justice. Killing is not the way out to deal with criminality,” said Mr Shipeta. Haki Africa’s Executive Director Hussein Khalid, who viewed the body at Coast General Provincial Hospital mortuary, said they were awaiting postmortem results before the family could be allowed to take the body for burial. PURSUED SUSPECT “We are with the family here. We are waiting directions from the police so that the family can take the body for burial,” he said. Mr Shee Hassan, 25, was gunned down at around 3pm in Barsheba on Tuesday. Four police officers raided Kisauni area as they pursued the suspect, whom they said, had been on their list of wanted criminals. According to eye witnesses, the police fired in the air to disperse residents during the operation. “After shooting in the air, they went for the suspect and shot him,” said Abdalla Ali, a witness.
