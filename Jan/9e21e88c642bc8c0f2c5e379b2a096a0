The number of coaches on the standard gauge railway (SGR) Madaraka Express train between Nairobi and Mombasa is set to drop in the next one day as passenger numbers reduce after the festive season. Kenya Railways Corporation said Monday the coaches will be reduced to nine from 14 for economy class passengers beginning Wednesday. The two coaches for first class passengers, however, will remain the same in the new service regime set to take effect starting January 2. The train is currently pulling nine coaches (1,062 passengers) on economy class tickets and two coaches (138 passengers) on the first class tickets. “In addition to the five coaches we add every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, we normally add more coaches on economy class seats if the demand is high to accommodate more passengers,” said a Kenya Railways spokesperson. “Now that the festive season has come to an end, we will go back to normal nine coaches we usually have on economy class coaches.” Daily departures The SGR passenger train service between Nairobi and Mombasa was launched last June.
