Kanbis, the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association Super Division Twenty20 champions, launch their title defence when they host Sikh Union at Eastleigh High School on Sunday as this year’s tournament starts. It is a game that Kanbis start as favourites to win, having one of the best fielding sides in the league and also owing to the fact that they have retained the same players for several seasons. Former Kenya national team captain, Rakep Patel, has been Kanbis’ main runs getter, and he pairs well with Nelson Mandela Odhiambo and Dhiren Gondaria. The trio are batsmen who can also bowl. Sikh Union, on the other hand, lost a number of key players last year and are rebuilding their side with the injection of a crop of young stars. Swamibapa, who were runners–up to Kanbis last year, will be at their newly-acquired home ground at Jamuhuri High School where they face Kongonis. Swamibapa have a good number of experienced players like Alex Obanda, Irfan Karim, Emanuel Bundi and Morris Ouma, all dependable batsmen. Swamibapa’s evergreen medium pace bowler, Lameck Onyango, will lead bowling attack. Stray Lion, who will be playing without their professional players from India will be home to Ngara at Peponi School, Ruiru. Without professional players, Stray Lions will be given a run for their money by Ngara. Obuya Academy will travel to Nairobi West where they will be hosted by Cutchi Leva at Samaj School. Last season Obuya Academy was strengthened by both Sikh Union players and former national team captain, Collins Obuya, who joined them from Stray Lions This is one game that could go either way as Cutchi Leva are capable of causing an upset. It is one game whose results will only be known when the last ball has been bowled. At Nairobi Gymkhana, the home team will face Ruaraka Sports club in what is expected to be an easy game for homeboys.
