Police in Vihiga County are holding a man accused of stealing Sh1.5 million from Sairam Supermarket in Mbale town on New Yearâ€™s eve. The suspect was apprehended on Wednesday morning while his accomplice, a watchman at the supermarket, is at large. RECOVERY Vihiga divisional police commander Justin Nyagah said the 23 year-old suspect was positively identified after police watched CCTV footage. He worked at the supermarket, which realised money had been stolen from its safe on January 1. Police reported on Wednesday that they found Sh1.2 million of the cash in the suspect's house. Some Sh300,000 and a mobile phone used to make transactions at the supermarket are still missing. PROBE Mr Nyagah said the supermarket is owned by Indian Yatin Patel, who reported the incident to police. Mr Patel said the building that houses the supermarket was locked at around 9pm on December 31. "When we opened the supermarket at 8am the following morning, it was discovered that the safe had been broken into and that the cash was missing," he said in a police seen by the Nation. The police boss said the suspect hid the money behind his television stand. "My officers visited the scene immediately and launched an investigation," he said, adding the suspect had been cooperating with them. "We want to gather all the relevant information," he said.   Supermarket owners say vice is not sporadic since it involves employees and there is a ready market for the loot.
