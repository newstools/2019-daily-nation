Ochieng missed three easy scoring chances in a row in the last quarter of the match that would have seen the soldiers grab maximum points. The soldiers have won only one game at home against KCB, whom they beat 2-0 in their season opener. Last season, Zoo Kericho under coach Sammy Okoth beat Ulinzi Stars home and away. more to follow....   Timona Wanyonyi had fired Mount Kenya ahead in the eighth minute.
