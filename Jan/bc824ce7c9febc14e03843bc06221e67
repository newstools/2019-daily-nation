Police in Siaya County have arrested a head teacher for failing to ensure that school reopens for the 2019 first term. Mr Samuel Aketch Agola of Kasau Primary School, is accused of illegally sending pupils on January 3, when they should have been learning. Mr Agola was arrested alongside the area assistant chief Margaret Anyango. The two suspects will be prosecuted, Nyanza Regional Coordinator Moffat Kangi said. Mr Kangi accused the head teacher of “failing to ensure that the school remained open for learning, which is an act of negligence of his duties and insensitivity to community needs.” He added: “The misconduct by the head teacher is not only infringement on the student right to education policies but also an affront to government education policies.” The administrator promised to see that that all schools remain open, secure and that learning goes on smoothly. It was not immediately clear whether the head teacher gave reasons for sending away the pupils, but the incident happened just a day after a Nairobi court nullified a planned nationwide teachers’ strike and ordered teachers to report to work as scheduled for first term. Mr Kangi and Siaya Education officials are set to visit the school on Monday to ensure learning activities have resumed.   The year's activities include the launch of the new curriculum.
