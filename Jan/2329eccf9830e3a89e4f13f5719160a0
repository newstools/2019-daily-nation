Judges resume work Monday after a month-long recess, with the country’s highest court expected to deliver rulings on election petitions that were concluded last year. Leaders waiting for decisions include Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud, his Homa Bay counterpart Cyprian Awiti, Lamu’s Fahim Twaha, and Laikipia’s Ndiritu Muriithi. Others are Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip, MPs Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Chamgamwe’s Omar Mwinyi, Justus Kizito (Shinyalu) and Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East). Also in the list are Wajir West MP Ahmed Kolosh and Ms Annie Kibe (Gatundu North). Before the December break, the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice David Maraga, delivered several judgments, handing political lifeline to Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, Kilgoris MP Gideon Konchellah, his Bonchari counterpart John Oyioka, Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and Marsabit Woman Representative Safia Adan. An appeal seeking to challenge the election of Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya was also dismissed but two legislators — Ugenya MP Christopher Karan and Embakasi South MP Julius Mawathe — were not so lucky, as the court upheld decisions nullifying their elections. IEBC has set April 5 for the by-elections.
