Tourism players at the Coast want Kenya Tourism Board (KTB), national and county governments to allocate more resources to market the sector in the devolved units. The players who reaped big from domestic and regional tourism during the December festivities want counties to especially focus on domestic tourism. According to statistics from the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers (KAHC) 60 percent of the total guests who spent their holidays at the Coast were domestic and regional tourists. KAHC official Mr Sam Ikwaye said counties stood to reap most in terms of revenue if they pump more resources to the industry. “There is significance in domestic tourism whose numbers were very good, an indication that we can rely and earn from the sector. We need to support domestic and regional tourism,” Mr Ikwaye said.
