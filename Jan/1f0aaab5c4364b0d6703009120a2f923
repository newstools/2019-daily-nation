The Democratic Party has denied claims that Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has formally joined the party. The party has dismissed the report as social media gossip. Secretary-General Jacob Haji asked Kenyans to ignore reports that have been circulating on social media platforms to the effect that the MP had decamped to the party that was founded by Kenya’s third President Mwai Kibaki. “We have seen a lot of comments on this report on social media platforms and we are concerned because as a party we are not aware. The MP has neither written to the party nor has he defected to join our party. The public must ignore these reports,” Mr Haji told the Nation in a statement. PARTY SYMBOL On Friday, Mr Kuria posted a picture of the party’s flag and lamp symbol and later posted that DP will be the party of choice for leaders in Mt Kenya. READ: Moses Kuria: We are headed to DP “To all my detractors out there, let us meet at the grassroots. DP is the party of the region. We leave the others to (Nominated MP Maina) Kamanda,” he posted on one of the post on social media. A section of the party’s leadership led by Deputy Secretary-General Wambugu Nyamu opposed Mr Kuria’s move and affiliation but later retracted their statement. POLITICAL CONTESTS Mr Haji said he was not aware of the MP’s statement indicating that he seeks to use the DP as a vehicle for his future political contests, noting that Mr Kuria can only do that after officially defecting from Jubilee Party. “Everybody is welcome to join our party, but through the procedure provided for in our party constitution. There is a way of joining our party which is not through social media posts.” The party said that for Mr Kuria’s comments can only be taken seriously if he writes officially to the party or meets the party official and express his desire. “He has not joined DP but he is welcome to be part of the family if he so wishes.”
