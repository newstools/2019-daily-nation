Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has differed with his Mathira counterpart Rigathi Gachagua over the proposal to create more positions through a constitutional referendum. Mr Kuria said a referendum to create more leadership positions to bring everyone on board is needed. He said the posts of president and deputy president cannot accommodate the political interests of all Kenyans. "When the time comes, let's expand posts through constitutional change so that we can accommodate all. There has been endless political squabbles because many people around the country feel isolated when one of their own has not taken the post of the president," Mr Kuria said. RUTO But he said the move is not aimed at politically disenfranchising Deputy President William Ruto who is eying the presidential seat after President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s term comes to an end. "Our brothers from Rift Valley should know that our intention is not lock out the DP through the anticipated change of law. We were initially opposed to the formation of counties as a region but we have now seen how useful they are and it is in the same way they shall find our proposal [to be good] once effected," he said. GACHAGUA But on his part, Mr Gachagua said he will not take part in a referendum that is aimed at creating posts for individuals. He urged people in the central region to only endorse proposed constitutional amendments that will address their dwindling economic fortunes as a result of poor pay for coffee and tea. "I want to urge my brother Kuria to go and tell those preparing this document to bring it first to us so that we can read it because we shall not support it if it's meant to create posts for certain individuals and not to improve the economic welfare of our people," said Mr Gachagua. The two were speaking during the funeral of the father of a prominent Nairobi based businessman Anthony Mithanga in Othaya, Nyeri County.
