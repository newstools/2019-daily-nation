The Supreme Court has dismissed petitions against the election of two governors, Embu's Martin Wambora and Nyamira's John Nyagarama. The judges on Wednesday ruled Mr Nyagarama was validly elected and that Mr Wambora's rival did not raise issues on the interpretation or application of the Constitution in his petition. This was Mr Nyambati's third attempt after High Court and the Court of Appeal quashed his earlier petitions. "The petitioner failed to produce evidence for his allegations and mostly worked on suspicion. The burden of proof lies with the petitioner," the High Court ruled in February last year. Mr Nyambati garnered 58,936 votes against Nyagarama's 65,161. JAMES MUKWE Kabuchai MP James Mukwe also retained his seat after the apex court overturned nullification of election by the Appeals court. According to the Supreme Court, the petition challenging his election was filed out of time in the Court of Appeal. The judges ruled that the Court of Appeal erred by wrongly allowing the time-barred petition.   Bids to unseat Embu and Nyamira governors to be decided today.
