No girl has been screened for evidence of female genital mutilation and paraded, says the Anti-FGM board chairperson Agnes Pareiyo. Speaking to journalists on Tuesday in Nairobi, Ms Pareiyo said that investigations by the board revealed that all girls are in school and none has been screened for signs of the practice, as had been stated by Narok County Commission George Natembeya last week. The directive had caused an uproar on the legality and ethical implications of conducting invasive inspections of girls' genitalia in an effort to prosecute parents who agreed to the process. "Following the county commissioners remarks, the board went round to Narok to investigate if screening was actually taking place. We found that it was only being discussed on mainstream and social media, in Narok, life goes on as usual.," Ms Pareiyo said. She said that the board has been working on a campaign to sensitise the FGM hotspots. She says so far the board has been to Narok, Elgeyo Marakwet, Bungoma, Marsabit, and Laikipia counties.   Kuppet official says the tests are demeaning and a violation of the girls' rights.
