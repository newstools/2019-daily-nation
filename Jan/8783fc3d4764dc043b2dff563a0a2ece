There are encouraging signs from the four counties chosen to pilot the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) programme. However, this early in the day, it appears as if it will be a steep mountain to climb. Since its launch on December 13, as part of President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s health pillar in his Big Four agenda, the programme underlines the commitment to extend access to healthcare to all, including the very poor. Health workers in Kisumu, Machakos, Isiolo and Nyeri counties have been overwhelmed by the demand. However, it provides a vital insight into the challenges the country will face as the affordable healthcare programme is finally rolled out to the rest of the counties. A recurring problem is the shortage of medical personnel, including doctors, nurses, other health cadres and support staff. Another challenge is inadequate facilities and medicines. This new initiative is expected to herald the transformation of the health sector which is hampered by inequalities because of poverty and lack of medical insurance. This is where the National Hospital Insurance Fund is expected to play a key role, with the first phase targeting 3.2 million patients, and the full rollout expected by 2022. This is a crucial feedback for Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki, who has been quick to assure the public that come next week, the challenges in the pilot will have been sorted out. Hopefully, the CS and her team will use their learning from this stage to good effect. President Kenyatta is also upbeat that the UHC will be achieved as promised by his government. His dream is to help ease the health burden many families shoulder. The UHC is the means to consolidate and revamp healthcare.
