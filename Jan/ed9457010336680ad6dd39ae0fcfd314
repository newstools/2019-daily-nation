A heightened sense of defiance has been the most admirable reaction to the latest terrorist attack in Nairobi in which nearly 20 people perished. The terrorists’ aim is to instil fear through their slaughter of innocent people. That Kenyans were just a day after the Dusit complex incident freely going about their business must have sent a message to these evil people that no amount of violence will cow them. But the IED explosion at the Tom Mboya Street-Latema Road junction in the city centre on Saturday evening, in which one person was injured, falls into the terrorists’ plot to disrupt people’s lives. Appearing to surrender or succumb to their evil designs would be handing them victory they do not deserve. There is, therefore, a need for increased alertness and vigilance as we have not seen the last of these attacks. We must, as individuals and groups, do whatever we can to enhance our safety. Of course, there are well-trained and equipped security personnel entrusted with providing our security but they cannot do it alone. After all, they cannot be everywhere at any time. The security agencies need our collaboration to ease their work of protecting us. All must, therefore, feel a civic obligation to volunteer useful information that police and other security agencies can use to prevent such crimes. While the call to arm security guards is understandable, it’s certainly not the solution to terrorism and other crimes. The people must be educated and sensitised on how they can contribute to enhancing their safety. Nyumba Kumi community policing often comes up for discussion whenever terrorists strike. Badly needed, however, is a network or mechanism that boosts information gathering and exchange to keep the merchants of death at bay.
