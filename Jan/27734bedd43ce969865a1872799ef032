In March, Kenya will host East Africa’s biggest golfing event, the Kenya Open Golf championship, at Nairobi’s Karen Country Club. Being held for the first time as part of the European Tour series with an improved prize fund, the tournament will attract highly ranked players from around the globe, making for a very tough competition. This is why local players must prepare adequately for the premier tournament. Sadly, not much has been done to raise the level of the local game since last year’s tournament, where the best-placed Kenyan player — Riz Charania — finished 69th. Following that poor performance at Muthaiga Club, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed Kenya Open Golf Limited to upgrade the tournament and come up with a clear programme to ensure that Kenyan players are adequately prepared to compete effectively. President Kenyatta’s intervention saw the birth of the ongoing Safari Tour tournament. But more still needs to be done. There are inadequate facilities to encourage individuals to take up the sport, and this is not helped by the belief that golf is an elitist sport. The government offered a piece of land for the construction of a public golf course at Kasarani, Nairobi, but, other than the putting up of a temporary driving range, nothing much has been done. Sadly, time is running out for the golfers. The golfing bodies — such as Kenya Golf Union, Kenya Ladies Golf Union and Kenya Golf Federation — must work harmoniously for the benefit of the local players. They must comply with the Sports Act to unlock funding from Sports Fund for the benefit of the players and the national teams. That may not produce immediate benefit for players this year, but it is good in the long run.
