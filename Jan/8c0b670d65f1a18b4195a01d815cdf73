A city lawyer was on Monday charged with stealing Sh6.5 million from a client, being proceeds from the sale of land. Mr Simon Shivaji is accused of stealing the amount between March 1 and July 31, 2015 from Ms Nelly Nafula Mutua. He allegedly received the money following the sale of the property. Mr Shivaji denied committing the offence before Senior Resident Magistrate Hellen Onkwani at the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi. He prayed for reasonable bond terms saying he could not raise a large sum of money as he was struck from the roll of advocates by the Law Society of Kenya’s disciplinary committee after Ms Mutua's complaint Mr Shivaji made the plea through his lawyer Polycarp Ongwae, who told the magistrate that he is financially handicapped. “My client cannot raise a high amount in cash bail or bond since he is not earning anything,” he said. "He has no means of raising money as he cannot practise." The magistrate also heard that another case was filed against Mr Shivaji at the High Court in a bid to recover the stolen money. The prosecution did not oppose the accused's but urged the court to consider the amount in question. Ms Onkwani directed the accused to deposit a cash bail of Sh800,000 or a bond of Sh1.5 million in order to be released from police custody. Should he be unable to, he will remain in detention until February 27 when the case will be heard.   Mr Daniel Peter Kinyanjui is facing two counts of theft and handling stolen property.
