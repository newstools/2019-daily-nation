A 14-year-old girl from Tana River County has walked for more than 15 kilometres in a bid to raise fees to join Bunyore Girls High School. Juliana Koshi, who sat her Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exam at Hola Primary School last year and scored 358 marks, has been working as a house help. The last born in a family of three girls and one boy earned her first Sh4,000, which she intends to use as part of her school fees. Juliana has been traversing across villages seeking for whatever little help she can get. "I have been to offices in the county but every time I got to the reception I am told I can't see a minister or an officer. Sometimes they are not around, so I decided to seek for help from well-wishers," she narrates. KIND PEOPLE During her journey, Juliana has met some kind people who have supported her. But she has also encountered hostile people along the way. Though tired and appears hopeless, Juliana believes she is more than just a house girl, and vows to keep walking until she raises enough money to enable start her studies at Bunyore Girls School. "I want to be a cardiologist. I am walking this hard not to fail, but to realise a dream that is more than being a maid. I have come from far to give up now," she says with a smile on her face. Her former employer has supported her while her brother tills farms in a bid to help her raise the money she needs. Juliana hopes to raise Sh53,554 for her fees and another Sh20,300 for other personal items needed in school. "The burden is too big for me alone. My dad, as you can see, is old and very sick. We are barely managing. Someone please come to my rescue," she appeals.
