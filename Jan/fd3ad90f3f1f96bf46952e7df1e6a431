A 15 -year-old orphan boy, who scored 347 marks in the national primary school examinations, has resorted to selling roasted maize with his grandmother for lack of school fees. David Purisaro wrote the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations at Tilak Primary School in Kapenguria Ward, West Pokot County. DREAM SCHOOL To join his "dream school" - Chepkorinisyo Boys' High school - Mr Purisaro needs Sh50,000 for school fees and Sh20,000 for shopping and mandatory items. He cannot raise these amounts because his parents died while he was young. The boy has been living with his grandmother, a widow, in a rented house at Mawingo Road slums in Makutano. He said he decided to sell maize with his grandmother on the streets of Kapenguria town after seeking in vain for financial aid. “All my friends have joined form one yet I roast maize,” he said and asked the public for help. "I was often sent home for lack of fees. I feel confused and uncomfortable because all my friends have already joined form one." Tilak head teacher Vincent Onege explained that the boy was eventually allowed in class as he was bright but needy. ENGINEER Mr Purisaro wants to become an engineer. "I hope to go to school so that I can help my grandmother," he said Mr Purisaro's grandmother, Judith Anyango, described him as disciplined. “His mother died when he was three years old. I roast maize to pay rent and buy food. I care for three other children,” she said. Neighbour Lillian Ondiek asked Governor John Lonyangapuo to step in.   Woman was distraught after failing to raise fees for her daughter who was due to join Form One.
