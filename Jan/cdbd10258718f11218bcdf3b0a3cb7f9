Confederation of African Football (Caf) has appointed Kenyan Fifa referees to handle the Confederation Cup play-off first leg encounter pitting Libyan side Ahli Benghazi and Nasr Athletic Hussein Dey of Algeria next Friday. The match will be staged at a neutral venue, the Mustapha Ben Jannet stadium in Tunisia, due to Libya's ban from the world football governing body, Fifa, on hosting matches. There has been civil war in the North African country since 2011. Peter Waweru, who is a lecturer in Mathematics at the Kenyatta University, will be the man at the centre. He will be assisted by Gilbert Cheruiyot from Eldama Ravine and Vihiga-based Tony Kidiya, also a teacher by profession. The Libyan side Benghazi dropped to the second tier inter-club championship after losing 4-0 on aggregate to Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in the Caf Champions League first round last month. Nasr Athletic, on the other hand, reached the play-off after eliminating Green Eagles of Zambia with a 2-1 aggregate score in the Confederation Cup first round. The reverse fixture to determine who advances to the group stage of the cup competitionÂ will be played on January 19.
