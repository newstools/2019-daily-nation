Former Kenyan international striker John Baraza has been handed the reigns at SportPesa Premier League side Sofapaka again. Baraza will handle the team following the resignation of Egyptian-born American coach Medo Melis on Tuesday. This is not the first time Baraza has been elevated to the head coach role. Last season, he was put in charge after Ugandan coach Sam Ssimbwa threw in the towel in April and led the team to the SportPesa Shield final losing 3-2 to Kariobangi Sharks on October 20 at Kasarani stadium. “Medo felt he was unlucky at Sofapaka thus he decided to resign,” Sofapaka president Elly Kalekwa told Nation Sport on Tuesday. “Baraza will be the senior coach but we will bring in someone to help him,” he added. Medo, who was hired in November last year from Mount Kenya United, formerly Nakumatt FC said: “We were playing one of the best football ever but some people kept on whispering all through, I am done with Sofapaka and won’t go back,” he said. Baraza will lead Batoto ba Mungu against seventh-placed Sony Sugar on Saturday at Kenyatta stadium, Machakos in his first match. The 2009 champions are ranked 11th on the table with seven points from as many games.   He took charge of the 2009 champions in November last year.
