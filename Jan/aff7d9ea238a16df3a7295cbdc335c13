Muslim leaders and human rights groups in Mombasa are up in arms after a Supreme Court decision that overturned the Court of Appeal ruling that allowed Muslim girls to wear the hijab in a church-sponsored school. A hijab is a head covering worn by Muslim women and girls in public. Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya and Haki Africa, a Mombasa based NGO, Thursday protested against the decision terming it as “unfair” to the Muslim community. CIPK organising secretary Sheikh Mohammed Khalifa said the decision by the top court is against the Constitution. “This is not right and the decision could disrupt peace amongst us as Kenyans. This is unfair and the decision has angered us as a community. We need this decision to be reconsidered,” said Sheikh Khalifa. Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid said they were “shocked and disappointed” by the decision claiming that it gives schools, particularly private ones, the discretion to decide whether to allow hijabs or not. “While the ruling does not automatically outlaw hijabs. It now means that Akorinos and Singhs will now also be forced not to wear their head gears while in such schools,” said Mr Khalid.   Judge says every school has a right to determine its uniform rules.
