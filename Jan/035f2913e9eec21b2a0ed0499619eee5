South African Premier Soccer League (PSL) giants Kaizer Chiefs has parted ways with Ugandan Godfrey Walusimbi barely five months after the left back penned a three-year deal with the Johannesburg-based club. Walusimbi joined the club on August 30 last year from Kenyan champions Gor Mahia for a reported Sh12 million, which was to be paid in two installments. Gor were reportedly expecting half of the amount in the course of this month. “The player has opted to go back home to Uganda. We would like to thank Godfrey for his contribution to Kaizer Chiefs and wish him all the best,” the club tweeted on Thursday, The 29-year-old, who leaves the club on the mid-season transfer deadline day down South, made 10 league appearances for the side. He was allegedly taking home Sh2 million in monthly salaries minus bonuses. Chiefs have struggled to keep their foot on the PSL title chase. They are fifth on the 16-team table with 27 points from 19 rounds. Walusimbi’s departure at Gor Mahia ended a four-year union between the Uganda Cranes player and K'Ogalo. Walusimbi joined Gor Mahia from Congolese side Don Bosco back in December 2013 and won three league titles and two domestic cups.
