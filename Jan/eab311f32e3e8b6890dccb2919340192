Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday dismissed remarks by Deputy President William Ruto that his perceived competitors in the 2022 State House race have nothing to offer and are only looking for endorsements to gain leadership. Other leaders also responded to Dr Ruto’s comment that he is not the automatic candidate for the ruling Jubilee Party in the 2022 presidential polls. He said that would accept the result of the party nomination, even if he loses. Mr Mudavadi said in a statement that it “is the DP who has hit the panic button for endorsement”. CAMPAIGNS Mr Mudavadi told Dr Ruto to "stop moving around the country talking about imaginary politicians seeking to be endorsed by Jubilee yet it is him and his supporters who are dying to get President Uhuru Kenyatta's nod in 2022. “The talk of paying political debts is synonymous with the DP inventing some form of debts owed by communities wherever he goes. The DP is using all manner of unorthodox tricks to force President Kenyatta to endorse him,” Mr Mudavadi said in a statement released by his press secretary Kibisu Kabatesi. Mr Mudavadi was responding to the DP’s comments on Wednesday when he hosted a delegation of leaders from Bungoma and Busia counties at his Sugoi home in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County. “Politics is about planning and mobilisation. There is nothing like this (State House seat) being endorsed. I have seen some hanging around waiting for endorsements,” Mr Ruto said during the meeting. MEETING ODM party national chairman John Mbadi (Suba South) and Kanu secretary-general Nick Salat also told off the DP over his comments . “What has he done to ensure that lives of Kenyans are improved apart from dishing hand-outs?” Mr Salat asked. The DP, who hosted another delegation of leaders yesterday at his Sugoi home, said he would take part in the party nominations.   Dr Ruto intends to succeed President Kenyatta after his term ends.
