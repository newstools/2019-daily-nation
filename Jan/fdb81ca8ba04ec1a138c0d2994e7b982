The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has on Wednesday asked Labour Court to compel teachers to call off their strike, saying it is ready for talks Submitting before Justice Byram Ongaya, TSC said it is willing to resume negotiations which were suspended in October last year. The teachers' employer said that for the sake of 12 million pupils in public schools, the strike should be suspended as negotiations continue. The court heard that the TSC is willing to reverse the controversial transfers if any teacher feels aggrieved. Further, the court heard that the employer has already rescinded some transfers and was handling appeals on case-by-case. But in response, Kenya National Union of Teachers Union through Senior Counsel Paul Muite accused TSC of acting in bad faith by transferring teachers outside a collecting bargaining agreement (CBA) and code of regulations. Further, Mr Muite said that the transfers have affected the operations of the union and broken down families. It was Knut's submission that the transfers and promotions were being carried out in an opaque manner and without their involvement as required by their CBA.
