Makerere University on Thursday asked lecturers sacked for absconding from duty to return the public funds they received as no work was done. The university fired 45 teaching staff on December 22, 2018, for reasons such as absconding, failure to complete their studies, financial fraud and insubordination. ZERO TOLERANCE Addressing a news conference at the institution, Vice-Chancellor Barnabas Nawangwe said the management would officially write to staff who received salaries getting dismissed. “[They] should refund it (the money). We cannot tolerate staff working elsewhere and earning from us without rendering any services," he said. Prof Nawangwe explained that the appointments board acted legally when it sacked the 45, whom he said were all granted fair hearings. However, he told those who felt aggrieved to file appeals with the tribunal. The VC vowed to punish staff members who speak ill of the university in public without its permission. Makerere's legal director Henry Mwebe told the press conference that the university will take the necessary measures to recover the money. The university bursar is expected to make the calculation. PETITION Some of the fired staff members petitioned parliament citing irregularities in the process. Speaker Rebecca Kadaga is expected to meet them on Friday. Prof Nawangwe castigated the lecturers for skipping the staff tribunal meeting but said Makerere management was ready to defend its decision at parliament. Mr Deus Kamunyu, chairperson of the Makerere University Academic Staff Association, approved the process the university intends to use to recover the money paid to the former employees. “Some were paid for over four years so if the university wants to force those people to refund the money, we cannot go against it. It’s a good move," Mr Kamunyu said. He advised Prof Nawangwe to stop castigating the staff for petitioning the minister of education.   Student told police varsity staff touched her private parts against her will.
