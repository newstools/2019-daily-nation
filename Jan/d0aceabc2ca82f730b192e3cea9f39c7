A storm is brewing after leaders from Kenya’s northern frontier counties faulted the proposed revenue sharing formula fronted by the Commission of Revenue Allocation (CRA), saying it is discriminatory and does not foster national unity. The leaders called on the Senate to reject the proposed formula until is it subjected to public participation, and if adopted to seek legal redress. “CRA does not give the basis of the parameters through which they reached on the sharing formula and assume that all the 47 counties in the country have the same level of development,” said the Frontier Counties Development Council (FCDC) chairperson, Ali Roba, who is also Mandera Governor. Governor Roba said the counties, which are marginalised and largely inhabited by pastoralists, stand to lose up to Sh100 billion in the course of the duration of the proposed formula. The FCDC leaders said their counties have recorded increased growth over the last 10 years which should be considered in the new formula. “The coming census must be done in a credible way, with the inclusion of international observers, and the results transmitted transparently and it will be realised that we have the numbers,” said Pastoralists Parliamentary Group (PPG) Secretary General, Rehema Dida, who is also Isiolo woman Representative.   Agency is said to have been infiltrated by politicians as it works new formula.
