Detectives in Mombasa are detaining three suspects linked to the murder of former Kilifi Deputy Governor Kenneth Kamto. The homicide detectives arrested the three in Nyali Friday morning and recovered from them a mobile phone said to have been stolen from Kamtoâ€™s house girl on the eve of Jamhuri Day last year. The three were escorted to Shanzu courts where the investigators were allowed to detain the three for 14 days to complete interrogations. Police said investigations would include using the mobile phone to trace more suspects linked to the murder who are still at large. The arrest of the three could be a breakthrough in an attempt to unearth the killers of Mr Kamto who human rights group and his family have been urging the government to identify and prosecute the culprits. The former deputy governor was shot three times in his sitting room by unknown gunmen at his Nyali residence in Mombasa. Preliminary reports from the police indicate that the killers, who had their faces covered, accosted him at around 4:45am as he entered his home and demanded cash before shooting him. They also robbed a guard before fleeing.   Gangsters accost Kamto as he enters his Nyali home and shoot him dead.
