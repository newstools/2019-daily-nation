Five bodies of victims of the Fort Ternan bus crash which occurred on October 10, 2018 are yet to be collected by relatives. Kericho County Police Commander James Mugera said the bodies of four men and that of a child still lying at the Kericho County Referral Hospital mortuary are yet to be identified and claimed by relatives. They are victims of the horrendous crash which occurred along the Londiani-Muhoroni road after a 62-seater bus christened Home Boyz belonging to Western Cross Express Sacco veered off the road while descending a steep slope, hit a guard rail, rolled and plunged down about 20 metres before landing on a rocky farm. "We have an update regarding the Tunnel accident that up to now, we still have five bodies lying at Kericho County Hospital mortuary which are yet to be identified and claimed by relatives. ASSIST "I want to call on anyone who had a relative in that ill-fated bus to come forward and assist us in identifying the bodies and claiming them because we're unable to continue holding the bodies at the mortuary," said Mr Mugera. Meanwhile, the bodies of six family members who perished at Chepseon on December 3 were on Saturday moved to Kisumu for further preservation as burial arrangements continue. A man identified as Ishmael Ogege died together with his son and four grandchildren. He was ferrying them in a salon car from his Nyakach home in Kisumu County to Londiani where they reside.   Mourners gather at villages in Kakamega and Vihiga counties.
