Fuel prices have fallen to a 13-month low after the Energy Regulatory Commission cut prices by up to Sh10 per litre in the latest price review on Monday. Motorists in Nairobi will for the next one month pay Sh104.21 for a litre of petrol, down by Sh9.33 from Sh113.54 they had been paying since December 14. The cost of a litre of diesel has fallen by Sh10.04, to retail at Sh102.24. Kerosene will retail at Sh101.70 in the city, having fallen by Sh3.52 per litre. The ERC said that the cost of crude for the deliveries that were ordered in December was 12.5 per cent lower at $59.50 per barrel compared to the price of $68 per barrel in November 2018, hence the steep fall in pump prices. The shilling also appreciated slightly during the review period, from Sh102.44 per dollar in November to Sh102.16 in December. Motorists in Mombasa will pay Sh101.60 for a litre of petrol, Sh99.60 for diesel and Sh99.09 for a litre of kerosene. In Nakuru, a litre of petrol will now be sold at Sh104.73, diesel and kerosene at Sh102.94 and Sh102.41 respectively. In Kisumu, petrol will retail at Sh105.73, while the pump prices for diesel and Kerosene have been set at Sh103.94 and Sh103.40 respectively.
