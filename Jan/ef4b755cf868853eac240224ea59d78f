Teachers and their employer will on Wednesday return to the Labour Court where a conciliator appointed by the Ministry of labour is expected to file a report on progress of their talks. Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) and the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) have held negotiations since late December in a bid to get an understanding on various issues in dispute. The parties will appear before Justice Maureen Onyango who has been hearing the matter. Mr Charles Maranga, the conciliator, has been racing against time in the last few days to get the warring parties strike a deal. AVERT STRIKE The conciliator was appointed in order to avert a teacher’s strike which had been called by Knut over promotion, transfers, performance appraisal and teacher professional development programme. Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion said promotion of teachers with higher academic qualification is a must. “The issue of promotion must be addressed and there is no two-way about it,” said Mr Sossion. He said the government only needs to allocate Sh6billion for promotion. “We have teachers who have served in one grade for close to 15 years. We cannot allow this to continue at all,” said Mr Sossion.   Nakuru Knut branch has the highest number of teachers who want promotion at 401.
