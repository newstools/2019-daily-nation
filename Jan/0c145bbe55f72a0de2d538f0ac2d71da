President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday ordered all Kenyans to be registered digitally and given Huduma identification numbers. Speaking at State House, Mombasa during a meeting with police commanders, regional coordinators and county commissioners, President Kenyatta said the database will also contain information of all foreign nationals residing in the country. “For each registration, the National Integrated Identity Management System (NIMS) will generate a unique identification number which will be known as the Huduma number,” said President Kenyatta. The Head of State said the integrated population registration system will be the authentic single source of truth on personal identity in Kenya. "To enhance the progress made by the Integrated Population Registration System, my administration will complete a central master population database which will be the authentic ‘single source of truth’ on personal identity in Kenya," he said. Mr Kenyatta said county commissioners will oversee registration of Kenyans in the new digital system.
