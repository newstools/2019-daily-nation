A new born baby boy has been rescued from a 20-foot pit latrine at Ikawa Mixed Secondary School in Tharaka-Nithi County where he had been thrown by his mother. Students who heard cries from inside the latrine reported the matter to the school’s administration who called in the police and the county emergency rescue team. After about two hours of struggle, the rescue team managed to get into the latrine and saved the baby. “We opened part of the 20-feet latrine and one of us went down using a crane and picked the baby,” said Mr Alex Mugambi, the manager of the county emergency rescue team. RUSHED TO HOSPITAL Chuka/Igambang’ombe OCPD Benson Makumbi said the baby was rushed to Chuka County Referral Hospital for medical check-up and the suspected mother arrested. “Both the suspected mother and the baby have been taken to hospital for medical check-up,” said Mr Makumbi. A nurse at the hospital, who declined to be named, told journalists that the boy was in good health. Outside the latrine, there was an old bloody mattress and a trail of blood that led to the latrine, suggesting that the baby was born there and later thrown away. Parents who arrived at the school to witness the shocking incident urged school girls to concentrate on their studies and avoid early pregnancies.
