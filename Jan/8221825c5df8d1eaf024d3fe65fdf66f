Mt Kenya lawmakers have cautioned politicians against reading too much into President Uhuru Kenyatta’s decision to reorganise government, saying that the move has nothing to do with the 2022 succession. Last week, President Kenyatta put Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i in charge of a committee comprising his Cabinet colleagues to supervise and inspect the implementation of government projects. Politicians allied to Deputy President William Ruto saw it as a move to isolate him and scuttle his plans to succeed President Kenyatta. But Central legislators led by Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua said that the Head of State had the prerogative to make changes in the government in his bid to ensure the efficient implementation of the Big Four agenda. His opinion was supported by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano and Nyeri MP Ngunjiri Wambugu. DEVELOPMENT Mr Gachagua noted that poor coordination at the national government had resulted in stalling of projects while others had become white elephants. “For so long we have witnessed uncoordinated approaches towards development. But with the new committee, the President can closely monitor projects,” he said. The lawmaker, who has often assured Mr Ruto of Mt Kenya region's support in his presidential bid said he had called for a meeting with administrators in his constituency to discuss the status of projects being undertaken by various ministries. According to Mr Kigano, the directive will tame lazy ministers and keep them on their toes to ensure speedy implementation of projects given that the President will be receiving accurate updates.
