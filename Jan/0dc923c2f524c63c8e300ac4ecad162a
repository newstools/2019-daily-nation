A day after he warned that corrupt and lazy county employees would be sacked, Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimeia has finally walked the talk. Mr Kimemia has ordered the sacking of a senior staff for allegedly stealing Sh36,000 from bursary fund kitty. In an internal memo, Governor Kimemia directed the Human Resource department to sack Kiburu-Njabini ward administrator for failing to account for Sh36,000 bursary funds disbursed in December last year. “I order immediate sacking of the ward administrator for failing to conduct bursary allocation in a transparent manner,” reads the copy of the letter by Governor Kimemia. The administrator is also accused of altering a list of bursary awards that had been approved by the bursary committee. He is said to have substituted some beneficiaries with his preferred candidates. LAZY OFFICERS He is also accused of altering the amounts of money awarded by the committee besides failing to disclose how Sh36, 000 was spent. The sacking comes a day after Mr Kimemia warned of severe disciplinary action against lazy and corrupt county officers. Addressing leaders at Ol Kalou Catholic Church on Thursday, Governor Kimemia vowed not to spare any corrupt or lazy civil servants. BURSARIES “I am aware that some dead persons were allocated bursaries, I want every coin meant for the needy children accounted for, we must ensure transparency in all our transactions, these are public funds and must be utilised to benefit the public,” said Mr Kimemia. Nyandarua County Secretary Hiram Mwangi, who confirmed the directive, declined to comment on the issue. “It’s true, I have seen a copy of the directive, the governor is committed to fighting corruption, but I am not in a position to further discuss the matter, it’s an internal issue,” said Mr Mwangi.   Kimemia assures Nyandarua residents of quality and timely service delivery.
