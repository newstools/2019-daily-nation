Revellers at the popular Club Sebs in Nakuru were treated to eye candy on Friday 29, 2018 when the club hosted a free fashion show to crown Miss Sebs 2019. This is a rare spectacle for Nakuru clubs. The event was created as a platform for youth keen on showcasing their talents in the ever dynamic and growing fashion industry. Young, upcoming models also got an opportunity to showcase their talent. Boniface Gitau aka Hush BK, a Nakuru-based artist and MC, says he organised the event to appreciate local talent. “I wanted to create a movement and a forum to showcase what Nakuru models are capable of. This was the first ever fashion show at the club but we will be doing it on a quarterly basis going forward,” he says. Thirteen contestants participated in the four categories of introduction, beach wear, casual and dinner wear. The winner, Lucy Boyane, walked away with Sh 10,000. The  first runner up Gladys Wairimu won Sh 8,000 and the second runner up got Sh 5,000 . The winner will mentor upcoming models and as the Club Sebs ambassador, she will hold onto the crown until the next fashion show to be held in early 2019.
