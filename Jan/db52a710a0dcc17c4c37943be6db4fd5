The University of Nairobi (UoN) has been given back its five-acre plot valued at Sh2 billion that had been grabbed by a private developer, eight years after filing complaint. The land was recovered through alternate dispute resolution (ADR) from Aberdares Engineering Contractors in the case that roped in the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The suspect behind land grab has been identified as 80-year-old Alfred Mwangi. UoN acquired the land in 1964 at Sh200,000 but the value has appreciated to between Sh2 billion and Sh5 billion, according to the universityâ€™s Vice-Chancellor Prof Peter Mbithi. EACC officials said they opted for the court-sanctioned ADR process because cases in court take too long. "Upon negotiations, Aberdares Engineering Contractors Limited agreed to surrender its title to the subject property and requested not to be prosecuted for criminal offences that may have been committed in the course of allocation," said Mr Michael Mubea, the EACC deputy chief executive. But the DPP Noordin Haji and EACC chief executive Twalib Mbarak said they are not setting a precedent with the case. They said it is only the Judiciary that can determine if land grabbers would be prosecuted or fined.
