The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs has blacklisted Tana River County for defaulting on loans from the Uwezo Fund. Speaking at a public forum in Hola, Gender Principal Secretary Safina Kwekwe said the residents had not paid their debts, despite borrowing heavily. "It is shameful for you to take these funds and fail to pay so that they can help other people,‚Äù the PS said. "You are supposed to repay so that another person can borrow," she said. Ms Kwekwe said that, of the Sh61 million allocated to the residents, they had borrowed Sh58 million in the last five years but had repaid only Sh1 million. She lamented that the trend is replicated in the Youth Enterprise kitty, whose Sh14 million borrowed in the last 11 years has not been repaid. The Principal Secretary urged the youths to pay up and apply for more loans so that they can build an enterprising society. Her sentiments were echoed by the Tana River Woman Representative Rehema Hassan, who cautioned the youths against squandering the money they borrow. She said groups with progressive ideas will receive funding while new ones will first be scrutinised.
