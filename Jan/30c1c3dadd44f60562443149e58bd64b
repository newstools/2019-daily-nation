An assistant chief from Migori County and his son have been charged with robbery with violence and assault at the Rongo Law Courts. North Kanyajuok Assistant Chief Joseph Nyamanga and his son Kennedy Nyamanga on Tuesday appeared before Rongo Senior Resident Magistrate Raymond Lang'at to answer to the charges. The court heard that the two, while armed with dangerous weapons including clubs and pangas, they attacked Mr Patrick Makabong'o and stole from him Sh21,000 and an Infinix phone worth Sh18,000. The two also are accused of causing bodily harm to the victim. FREED ON BOND They denied the charges and were each released on a Sh200,000 bond with surety. The court ordered them to report to the Kamagambo Police Station every first and last Friday of the month pending the mention of the case on January 25 and hearing on February 25. Mr Makabong'o was seriously wounded last week on Saturday when a fight erupted between two factions battling over a 1.4-acre piece of land in Kitere, Rongo Constituency. FIGHT According to Rongo OCPD Kibet Kirui, a fight ensued when the victim had gone to work on the farm. "While on the farm, he was attacked by a group of youths who beat him repeatedly before police officers from Rongo Police Station intervened," said Mr Kirui. The OCPD said police are pursuing the youths who took part in assault. "We have launched a manhunt for the youths," he added. The Makabong'o and Nyamanga's families have been fighting over the ownership of the piece of land. While Philip Makabong'o claims to have bought the land, the assistant chief insists that his brother sold it to Mr Makabongo unprocedurally and therefore decided to challenge the sale in court.
