Narok North MP Moitalel Ole Kenta has decried the increasing bombardment of insults by youths to the elected leaders in the social media platforms in the region. The legislator accused the youths of fuelling a hate campaign agenda against the leaders and urged them to desist from use of abusive language. The legislator said the use of derogatory language on elected leaders has been on the rise especially on social media platforms with the youths forming groups whose aim is to demean the leaders. “It is unfortunate that in Kenya today, a huge number of youths on social media platforms are using it negatively either to blackmail leaders or spew insults to cause tension and division in the society,” he said Saturday. The MP warned politicians against funding youths to spread smear campaigns against their opponents. Last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta assented to the Computer and Cybercrimes Bill to deter such cyber bullies and spread of fake news. The law aims to curb the use of abusive language on social media and discipline those who fail to adhere. According to the new law, a person who knowingly publishes information that is false in print, broadcast, data or over a computer system, that is calculated or results in panic, chaos, violence among citizens of the republic, or which is likely to discredit the reputation of a person commits an offence and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh5 million or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.
