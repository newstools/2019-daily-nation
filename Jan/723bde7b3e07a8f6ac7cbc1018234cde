Eldoret Youths FC held visiting Kisumu All Stars to a 1-1 draw in and exciting National Super League match played at the Eldoret Showground on Wednesday. The game started off slowly as both teams tried to unlock their opponents steady rear guard with no visible success. Kisumu dominated possession in the early exchanges but their finishing let them down. Eldoret Youth’s Joseph Oyugi broke the deadlock on 33rd minute with a header sending the sizeable crowd that turned up on the sunny afternoon into a frenzy. Their celebration was short-lived as Dennis Ochieng restored parity four minutes later, albeit in a controversial way. The centre referee had disallowed the goal leading to bitter and acrimonious protests from the visitors. He later pointed at the centre after consultations with assistant referee and the fourth match official. Speaking to the Nation Sport after the final whistle, Kisumu All Stars tactician Francis Oduor lauded his boys on getting a point in Eldoret, at the same time lashed out at the referee for trying to deny them a goal. “The game was good despite the fact that we lost so many open chances. Next time we hope that we shall improve on our finishing because we really want to qualify for the Kenya Premier League at the end of the season,” said Mr Oduor. On his part, Eldoret Youth coach Rodgers Nandwa praised his charges for the good display and expressed his confidence that team is building up momentum as they push for KPL qualification. “The boys have really improved noting that we have lost two consecutive games away. The boys are ready to learn from their mistakes,” said Mr Nandwa. Kisumu remain fifth with 20 points while Eldoret Youth are 12th with 15 points.   The win is Ushuru’s ninth of the season.
