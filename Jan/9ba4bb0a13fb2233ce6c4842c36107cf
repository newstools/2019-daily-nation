A police officer attached to the Kenya Ports Authority shot himself dead in a washroom on Saturday morning. Mr Charles Ndolo was alone when the incident took place at about 4.45am, said Kilindini divisional police commander (OCPD) Patrick Lobolia. PROBE “He went to the toilet at gate 18 of the port in Kipevu area and shot himself in the mouth. We don’t know the motive but we have started investigations,” Mr Lobolia told the Nation on phone. He said they were looking for the officer's phone to check for the people he contacted before taking his own life. The body was taken to Jocham Hospital mortuary. Mr Ndolo's case is the latest among many deaths by suicide by individuals across the country. On December 20 in Isiolo town, an Administration Police officer shot and killed his girlfriend before turning the gun on himself. The two had had an argument. County Commissioner John Ondego said the officer was 47 years old and that he had served for 25 years. He was employed in 1993. COUNSELLING Following many cases of suicide and murder-suicide by people in the police service, Inspector-General Joseph Boinnet urged police to seek counselling. In Mombasa last November, IG Boinnet said, “We want to support officers who require help because of the tremendous stresses that police work exerts on us. Majority of police officers work very well but a few, occasionally, break down. “We have created a department of counselling and are in the process of decentralising the service to regions. With enough resources, we will go further into the counties." The National Police Service Commission established a counselling and rehabilitation centre in October to address psychosocial or stress-related problems affecting officers.   Police will establish why he had his gun while on sick leave.
