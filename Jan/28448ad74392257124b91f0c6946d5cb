A primary school teacher in Narok County is on the run after impregnating his pupil during the KCSE exams last year. The girl is now likely not to join Form One due to her situation. The Nation learnt that the girl is not willing to proceed to high school after having been in an affair with the teacher before she sat for her national examination last year. Narok County Commissioner George Natembeya said the girl’s father reported the incident to his office requesting for action on the culprit who teaches in a private school in Narok town. MANHUNT “Police have launched a manhunt for the suspect who is still at large. Our campaign will not stop until such sex pests are brought to book,” said Mr Natembeya during a press briefing in his office on Tuesday evening. Mr Natembeya had earlier directed that schoolgirls in upper primary and in secondary schools undergo pregnancy and FGM tests when reporting to school. Meanwhile, police in Transmara West Sub-County have arrested a primary school teacher accused of defiling a Standard Seven pupil last year. ON THE RUN According to Deputy County Commissioner Hassan Noor, the teacher has been on the run since he allegedly committed the heinous act on the minor on December 26, 2018. “We received information around 9am that the teacher had reported back to school. We sent our officers who managed to arrest him and took him to Emurua Dikirr Police Station,” said the administrator. Mr Noor said police have been looking for the suspect for over two weeks and that his arrest was a major boost in the fight against defilement cases which he said have been on the rise in the area. Mr Natembeya noted that the suspect had been booked for interrogations before he is arraigned. The commissioner regretted that some teachers, who are mandated to take care of the children, are turning beastly and preying on the innocent minors.
