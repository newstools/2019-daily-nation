The Supreme Court will on Wednesday deliver judgments in three election petitions, among them a case challenging the election of Embu Governor Martin Wambora. The election of Mr Wambora had been nullified by Justice William Musyoka in February last year, saying the vote recount and scrutiny had unearthed various irregularities that compromised the integrity of the process. But the governor moved to the Court of Appeal and Justices William Ouko, Daniel Musinga, and Fatuma Sichale said the burden of proof was not discharged by former Senator Lenny Kivuti. The three judges overturned the decision, ruling the High Court erred in invalidating Mr Wamboraâ€™s election. Not satisfied, Mr Kivuti moved to the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the decision. The top court will also give their verdict on a petition filed against Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama. The petition was filed Mr Walter Nyambati but High Court judge James Aaron Makau dismissed the case last year. Mr Nyambati filed an appeal but the case was equally dismissed forcing the former MP to move to the Supreme Court. Also to know his political fate is Kabuchai MP James Mukwe. So far, the court has nullified the election of Mr Ahmed Kolosh (Wajir West), Mr Chris Karan (Ugenya) and Mr Julius Mawathe of Embakasi South. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has already set April 5 for the by-elections in Embakasi South and Ugenya.
