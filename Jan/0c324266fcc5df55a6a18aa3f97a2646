A court has ordered public health officers to destroy over 500 kilogrammes of assorted rotten meat seized from a house in Kilimani estate. Milimani Law Courts Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot allowed a request by health officers to be permitted to dispose off the rotten meat. The meat was seized Tuesday and three Chinese nationals, alongside a Kenyan man, arrested during a police raid following a tip-off from their neighbours. “A stench emanating from the residence of Shang Li Yan, Xing Wei and Zhang Jie made some of the neighbours to move out of their houses,” a state prosecutor said. Ms Yan denied that she was found selling food under unsanitary conditions. She denied selling 95 kilogrammes of red meat, crab fish 285 kilogrammes, raw fish 130 kilogrammes and assorted meat comprising raw chicken and pork. The second charge stated she had five cartons of canned fish packed in 250 grammes whose expiry date had lapsed. The court ordered the suspects be detained longer to allow police conclude investigation. The three will be produced in court on January 14.
