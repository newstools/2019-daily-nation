Former presidential candidates Peter Kenneth and Martha Karua on Wednesday led leaders from Mt Kenya in castigating legislators from the region whom they accused of disrespecting President Uhuru Kenyatta. In a statement, the leaders said that there was a plot to sabotage the March 9 handshake between President Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga as well as the government's fight against corruption. "We are treading on very dangerous ground here. The president's anger on those saying there was no development was only directed at leaders who have been misled, " Ms Karua said. The leaders said that the President had initiated development projects in the region, and that if they are aggrieved, the leaders should use other channels "that show respect and decorum." "Development projects are laid out through Parliament, and the Executive implements what has been passed. We want to ask those MPs to go back to the House and make sure it happens as they want," said Mr Kenneth. SUCCESSION DEBATE On the succession debate, Mr Kenneth said: "How can we talk about a vacuum when there are people in the president and deputy president's position?" He asked: "We do not have a lame duck presidency. You can take that to the bank." Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and his Bahati counterpart Kimani Ngunjiri have ran a campaign in the past few days to demand for what they said should be a fair share of the development projects. "Nobody is the presumptive president in 2022. No one is entitled to it," Ms Karua said. According to Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, Mr Kuria's complaints about lack of development in the county are misguided."I am the governor and I know what has gone where in development," Mr Waititu said.   Mr Murathe declared recently, â€œThe stop Ruto movement is unstoppable."
