Two people have died on after their staff bus was hit by lorry at the Bonje black spot in Kilifi County. Confirming the Thursday morning incident, Rabai OCPD Michael Ndonga said the staff bus belonged to Buzeki transport company and was heading towards Mariakani when it was hit. "It's true we have lost two people who were in staff bus. It belongs to Buzeki transport company," Mr Ndonga said. The police boss said that the lorryâ€™s driver lost control as he drove along the steep side of the road towards Mombasa. BRAKES FAILED "The lorry was driving towards Mombasa and on reaching Bonje its brakes failed and it veered off the road towards the other lane. It had a head on collision with the staff bus, killing two people on the spot. Several others were injured and taken to hospital. I will issue more details once I get them," Mr Ndonga said. A motorcycle rider who witnessed the incident said the lorry was speeding towards the Mombasa direction but the driver was forced to apply emergency breaks after another lorry that was in front stopped abruptly. "There was a loud bang and then everything went silent. Soon there was a cry for help from the passengers who were in the staff bus. I rushed and found two people already dead. It was a grisly and disturbing picture," said the witness. SAD A staffer who did not want to be named said it was sad that two of his colleagues had lost their lives in such a manner. "It was the mistake on the side of the lorry driver. Our driver was right on his lane but the lorry veered off the road and ended up crushing our staff bus. Our driver has been injured and has a broken arm and thigh. It's very unfortunate," he said. The Bonje stretch, just a kilometre past Mazeras, is a notorious black spot prone to car crashes with motorists having to negotiate sharp bends every day. Crashes on the section that stretches to Miritini happen almost daily.
