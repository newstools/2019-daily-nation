Sofapaka and visiting Sony Sugar battled to a goalless draw in a SportPesa Premier League match at Kenyatta stadium, Machakos on Saturday. This is the sixth time this season that Batoto ba Mungu have failed to win. Jeconiah Ogendo brought down Ellie Asieche outside the box in the fifth minute but the resultant freekick taken by Dennis Odhiambo was dealt with by Sony defence line. On 20 minutes, Ronald Omino unleashed a rasping shot forcing Sofapaka goalkeeper Justin Ndikumana to parry for a corner. Omino was a constant menace on the right, keeping Sofapaka left back Titus Achesa on toes. On 41 minutes, he won a free kick outside 18 but sent it wide. Sofapaka stand-in coach John Baraza pulled out Mike Oduor for Cliff Kasuti at restart as the former Ulinzi Stars winger resumed his offensive duties after weeks playing as a right back under former coach Medo Melis. John Avirre's glancing header from a George Maelo deep cross missed the target by a whisker on 54 minutes. Avirre went up in the air to meet the ball with Kasuti, the latter unable to continue after landing awkwardly, Cornelius Juma replaced him at the hour mark. The game turned physical in the final exchanges with neither side utilizing few sniffs at goal. Umaru Kasumba fluffed Sofapaka's best chance on 83 minutes blasting wide from close range after being set up by John Avirre who had raced down the left flank before cutting back.
