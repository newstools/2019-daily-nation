Police in Murang'a have arrested a 35-year old man from Kandara after he was allegedly found defiling his eight-year old daughter. His wife who was returning home from the market on Wednesday evening, is said to have found him in the act. Kandara OCPD Wilson Kosgey said the suspect’s wife made a distress call, attracting the villagers who roughed up the man and later called the police. The police boss said the girl’s mother later recorded the statement at Kandara Police Station giving her account of the happenings, prompting the officers to launch investigations. LOCKED UP "The suspect is in our custody and we intend to arraign him on Friday when we are through with investigations, "I commend the locals for their decision of not lynching the suspect so that the victim may get judicial justice if the suspect will be found guilty," he said. The police boss called on residents not to shy away from reporting their relatives when they commit crimes such as rape and defilement, saying that pardoning them only worsens the situation. FOUND IN THE ACT The wife of the suspect narrated how she found her husband in bed with their first-born daughter. "I had come from the market when I entered the house only to find my husband in bed with our daughter who did not have an idea of what was going on. "I was very confused. I screamed and the locals came and started roughing up my husband. It’s a sorry and awkward state but I pray that justice will be served to my daughter," she said. She called on counselling experts to help her daughter overcome the ordeal so that the incident does not haunt her in the future and lower her self-esteem. "I'm afraid that when my daughter matures, the incident may come back to haunt her and affect her future and I call on well-wishers to help her get out of it through counselling," she said.
