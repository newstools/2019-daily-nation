A herder is nursing injuries after he was shot in an attack at Yatya in Baringo North by bandits suspected to be from a neighbouring community. Mr Charles Kiburet was watering his livestock on Wednesday afternoon at a dam when he was shot by armed bandits who also made away with more than 30 head of cattle. Mr Kiburet said he was driving his cattle away from the dam after watering them when he was attacked. “I heard gunshots and when I tried to check where the attackers were shooting from, I saw blood on my left arm. That is when I realised I had been shot. I did not see the attackers but I heard five gunshots. I ran towards Yatya trading centre, leaving the livestock behind,” he said. Mr Kiburet was taken to hospital where he is recovering after surgery. Saimo Soi MCA Richard Cheserem condemned the attack and called on security agencies to deal with rampant cattle raids and bandit attacks in the area. Meanwhile, Tiaty Deputy County Commissioner Jacob Awuor confirmed that police reservists from the two communities jointly recovered 14 of the stolen livestock at Kositei in the neighbouring Tiaty Sub-County.
