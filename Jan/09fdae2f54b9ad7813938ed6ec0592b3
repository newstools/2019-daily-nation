Migori town residents were on Thursday treated to drama when a man bought his own coffin in preparation for his death over alleged domestic squabbles with his wife. The man is said to have approached a carpenter and asked for the price of a coffin saying he was “tired.” “He was wearing a boda boda reflector jacket and we thought he was inquiring on behalf of a deceased colleague because boda boda organisations always send representatives to buy coffins when colleagues die,” Alphonce Odhiambo, a carpenter said. Mr Odhiambo said he told the man that the coffin goes for Sh15,000 and he haggled for Sh13,000 and paid. “When we asked him who had died, he said he was supposed to be the body. Fitted into several coffins and picked his size,” Mr Odhiambo added. The man later paid for a motorbike which took him inside the coffin to his house. Riders said the short distance to the man’s home within Migori town is always Sh 50 “but the man paid us handsomely so we were happy as we escorted him to his home.” He said he has been married for 18 years and has three children but his wife has been a nag. But neighbours say he is very drunk and irresponsible. “He once walked into Migori referral morgue and told morticians that he had a body to be preserved before being restrained as he tried to enter into a freezer,” a mortician at the hospital told Nation.
