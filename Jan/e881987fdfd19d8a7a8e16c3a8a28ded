Residents of Balambala in Garissa County will benefit from a water project launched by Governor Ali Korane on Friday. Governor Korane commissioned the Kasha Water Supply that was co-funded by the county government and Unicef. Mr Korane said similar projects will be initiated in other regions so that both humans and livestock can have access to the vital commodity. He acknowledged water executive Issa Oyow for his efforts in improving water coverage in the vast county. In the 2017/2018 financial year, the regional government drilled 20 boreholes in the six sub-counties of Fafi, Ijara, Hulugho, Lagdera Balambala, Dadaab and Garissa Township.
