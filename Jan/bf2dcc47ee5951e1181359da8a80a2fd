The 2016 Africa Cross Country bronze medallist Charles Mneria finally used the right amour to chalk his first win during the Kenya Prisons Service Cross Country Championships at Prisons Staff Training College, Ruiru on Saturday. Prisons Headquarters’ Mneria, who represented Kenya in 5,000m race at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, cracked the whip in the third lap to win in 29 minutes and 12.5 seconds. Guest athlete Joshua Nakeri came in second in 29:52.2 as Nairobi’s Emmanuel Ngatuny wrapped up the last podium place in 29:53.4. The 2011 World 1,500m silver medallist Silas Kiplagat from Rift Valley timed 30:15.9 for fourth place in a race where defending champion Cornelius Kangogo of Prisons Headquarters wound a distant 10th in 30:52.1. “It was a very tight race with a very strong field, it’s my desire is to represent Kenya once again but I am sure it won’t be easy during the nationals,” said Mneria. The 2016 Africa 10,000m silver medallist Wilfred Kimitei (North Eastern) came in fifth after finishing third last year while the 2007 Osaka World marathon champion Luke Kibet settled eighth.
