A Chinese contractor in Kisii County has been sued for allegedly stealing soil valued at Sh3.7 million from a Bonchari home. Appearing before Senior Resident Magistrate Stephen Onjoro at the Kisii Law Courts on Monday, Mr Zhang Shaowei was charged with stealing soil from Mr Enock Onchangwa on diverse dates between July 11 and August 6, 2018 at Wanjare sub location. “On July 11, 2018 the China Henan International Cooperation Group Company Limited in Kisii made two false documents namely lease agreements purporting them to be genuine lease agreements for land parcel Wanjare/Bogiakumu/97,” Mr Onchangwa’s lawyer said in his submissions. But Mr Shaowei’s lawyer, Mr Richard Machage, said his client paid Sh88, 000 for the alleged stolen soil. The magistrate released the accused on Sh100, 000 cash bail and set mentioning of the case for January 14.
