Athletics Kenya has appealed to county governments to channel some of their budgetary allocations for sports towards athletics programmes, particularly championship events. AK Treasurer David Miano Tuesday disclosed that the federation’s respective county offices have submitted their budgets to various county governments with the hope of funding athletics activities this season. Miano urged county government officials to emulate their counterparts in Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Nyandarua, Taita Taveta and Nyeri who have supported athletics activities, leading to growth of talent in their areas. Miano noted that most of the counties will stage their cross country championships this weekend to select their teams for the Regional Cross County Championships planned for February 9. The regions will then select their teams that will compete with teams from other regions, among them Kenya Police Service, Kenya Prisons Service, Kenya Defence Forces and Kenya Universities, at the national cross country championships slated for February 23 at Eldoret Sports Club. It’s in Eldoret that AK will pick a team for the World Cross Country Championships due March 30 in Aarhus, Denmark. “After the Cross Country Championships we shall move to the relay and track and field season and we hope the county governments will lend us support,” said Miano, adding that Kenya has great potential of producing great athletes. Miano said that counties should also bid to host national championships, especially now that there is more interest countrywide after Uasin Gishu won the bid to host the national cross country Championships. “It’s encouraging that there is now interest from other counties in hosting national events. It’s only through such partnerships with the county governments that we will realise credible success,” said Miano.
