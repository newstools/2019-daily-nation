Police in Kosovo, Naivasha, are looking for a man who allegedly killed his 24-year-old cousin over a Sh70 debt. The two, according to Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru, picked up a quarrel in Ndabibi on New Year's Eve. Mr Waweru said it was while they argued that the accused stabbed his cousin Laban Barsale in the chest and then fled. “We have one person in custody, who is assisting us with investigations,” he said, without revealing what the debt was for. The victim's uncle reported the matter to the police. The body was taken to the Naivasha sub-county hospital mortuary.   Migori county police boss David Kirui said their investigations have discounted the previous claim of a love affair.
