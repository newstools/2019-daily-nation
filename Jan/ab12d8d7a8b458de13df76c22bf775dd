After a two-week recess, the National Super League (NSL) action resumes on Saturday with 10 matches on the cards. Leaders Ushuru will be looking to pick from where they left before the festive break when they visit Thika United at the Thika Sub-County Stadium in a 4:15pm kick-off clash. Ken Kenyatta's charges beat Wazito 2-0 in their last outing at Ruaraka to move to the top of the 20-team league with 13 points from five matches. Second-placed Shabana take on third-placed Wazito at the Gusii Stadium in another afternoon encounter expected to be explosive. The Glamour Boys, who grabbed maximum points off Kibera Black Stars to finish 2018 second, will be banking on home advantage to get maximum points against Wazito who suffered their first defeat of the season against the taxmen. Only one point separates the two sides. “I’m glad the boys have remained focused as we yearn for more good results in the remaining fixtures,” said Shabana coach Gilbert Selebwa. Fourth-placed Nairobi Stima, who have 11 points, will host Fortune Sacco at Karuturi in Naivasha on Sunday while Administration Police take on visiting Green Commandos at Camp Toyoyo. In other matches on Saturday, newcomers Eldoret Youth will be up against Kibera Black Stars at Eldoret Show grounds as Bidco United welcome Migori Youth at Thika in an early kick-off.
