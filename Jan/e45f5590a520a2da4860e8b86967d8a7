The third international No-Boundaries International Art Exhibition will be held in Nairobi at the Columbia Global Centers on Tuesday, January 15. Dubbed One Tree, One City, the exhibition features 150 artworks by children from 15 countries, including artworks by kids from the Nairobi area and across Kenya. Columbia Global Centers, in partnership with the No-Boundaries Committee, launched the third annual 2018 No-Boundaries International Art Exhibitions to foster global awareness and social responsibility in young citizens around the world. The theme “One Tree, One City,” encourages exploration of the bond between cities, trees and nature through art. SELECTED ARTWORK The exhibitions aim to build an international art and educational platform by connecting young artists without boundaries of nationality, languages, or culture. The art has been shown in galleries open to the public in the host cities of Beijing, Paris, New York and Rio de Janeiro since July 2018. They have been appearing at the other regional hubs throughout January, which also includes Nairobi. Each city will exhibit selected artwork of children locally and from the other sites, and display a digital representation of all the artwork from children worldwide. A note from No-Boundaries Committee in anticipation of the launch read, “As we head into our third year, we are as dedicated as ever to hosting an amazing and inspirational exhibition that strives to provide an educational and international platform for students worldwide to display their artwork, learn from with each other, and to cultivate their global awareness and social responsibility. Your attendance will further encourage children to become caring global citizen. We cordially look forward to seeing you and your artworks in the exhibition.”   Through a series of old and recent photographs, maps and text, an historical and architectural exhibition dubbed Nyrobi in Pictures runs from this week to the end of June at the French Cultural Centre.
