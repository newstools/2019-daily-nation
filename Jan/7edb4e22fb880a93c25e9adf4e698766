A man died in Narok County on Friday when the petrol tanker he had been driving exploded following an accident. Narok East Sub-county Commissioner Athure Bunde said the accident took place on the Duka Moja stretch of Narok-Mai MahiuÂ Road at about 10.30pm. COLLISIONS The incident was reported at Ntulele Police Station, whose officers said the driver of the tanker lost control in descent and hit two vehicles including a truck. The tanker then tipped over and a fire started in its cabin. Narok County fire fighters responded. Mr Bunde said the occupants of the other vehicles survived and were taken to Narok County Referral Hospital. The wreckage was towed to Ntulele.   BLACK SPOT On Saturday morning, protesters blocked that section of the road using rocks and burning tyres, reports indicating that this had to do with the accident. Police later removed the barriers and restored traffic flow. The scene of the accident is a black spot where many have died. About two months ago, five people died there after three vehicles collided.   The Nation team has seen 11 vehicles burnt to shells with charred bodies sprawled all over.
