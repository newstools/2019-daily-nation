Police in Nakuru are investigating the mysterious death of a Kenya Defence Forces officer in a room at Nakuru’s red-light district two days before the new year. Area police boss Samuel Obara said detectives will establish the cause of the death of the officer, who was found dead last Sunday. AUTOPSY According to Mr Obara, the body had no visible body injuries. “We are investigating the circumstances under which a KDF officer of the rank of a captain was found dead in a room,” said Mr Obara. “We are also waiting for the autopsy report. That is the information I have so far,” said Mr Obara. Efforts by the Nation to establish the fallen officers’ working station were futile as KDF public affairs spokesperson Colonel Paul Njuguna did not respond to our calls and text messages. Nakuru County is home to several army barracks, including Third Kenya Rifles, 81Tank battalion, and is also the home of Kenya Military Academy. A police officer involved in the probe said the army captain had booked a room in a lodge on Kanu Street on Saturday evening. MEDICINE He, however, failed to wake up the following morning, prompting the management of the guest house to alert police. “We found some medicine inside the room but we are yet to establish whether he was alone in the room,” said a police source. The officer told the Nation that workers on duty that night have already recorded statements with the police over the incident. “We are at the initial stages of our probe but we have lined up several people for questioning,” said the police source. KDF officers from the military police are also assisting the police with the investigations.   Witnesses say the man had been drinking with two women.
