A ferry plying the Mbita-Mfangano route in Lake Victoria was on Wednesday evening forced to change its course on due to strong winds. The ferry operators were forced to dock at a different location when the lake became rough. The ferry was carrying 10 people and one vehicle from Mfangano Island to Mbita Town. But its captain changed course and docked at Sienga on Rusinga Island when its movement was compromised by the rough waters. Mbita Ferry Services Manager James Orage said the vessel, which can carry 60 passengers, turn in the middle of the lake to protect the commuters from drowning in case of an accident. ROUGH SECTION “The captain straggled for about 20 minutes to go through a rough section in the lake. He was approaching his destination in Mbita. He then changed his course when he realised that the ease of movement became tough,” Mr Orage said by phone Thursday. The vessel docked for one hour at Sienga before proceeding with its journey to Mbita Town. Some frightened passengers complained of the delay and demanded for an explanation on what was going on. The passengers sent distress calls to their relatives saying that the ferry had stalled in the middle of the lake. But Mr Orage described the situation as a normal emergency procedure. “The captain stopped for a while as he tried to make his way through the water to Mbita. However, some passengers who are not conversant with maritime [procedures] became frightened over what was going on,” he said.
