The giant teachers' union, Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut), on Monday announced it has rejoined Francis Atwoli's Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu). Knut Secretary-General Wilson Sossion said the decision to take 312,000 teachers to Cotu was agreed on during their 61st Annual Delegates Conference held last year. The union made the decision to ditch Trade Union Congress, Kenya (TUC-Ke) which Mr Sossion championed for in 2014. Mr Sossion said the move is meant to unite all workers in the country as he asked employers and government not to fear the strengthened labour union. "We will fight for the rights of workers in this country," said Mr Sossion. Knut was a founder member of Cotu in 1965 but left in 1969.
