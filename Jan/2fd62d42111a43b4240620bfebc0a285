Warring factions in the Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) came together at a joint press conference to address pertinent issues affecting the sport. Wrangles had caused confusion with the 2018 National League ending in disarray as the two factions staged separate competitions. Athletics Kenya president Jackson Tuwei had to step in to not only broker truce, but also bring together Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa and BAK president John Kameta, who were not seeing eye to eye. The truce saw Echesa form a Boxing Consultative Committee comprising officials from the two factions with a view to laying down modalities for fresh elections. BAK has not conducted elections for two years with the poll  having been postponed several times. The last time the elections were to take place was on January 18, but the Boxing Consultative Committee deferred them to allow the Registrar of Sports to finalise the issuance of registration certificates to the 19 counties that are expected to participate. We now hope that the newfound sobriety and goodwill will prevail with the registrar fast-tracking the certificates. BAK needs a credible and genuine leadership that will put in place development structures to bring back on track the declining sport. It will be upon the delegates to vote wisely. They need to elect people who have boxing at heart and not those out to use the sport for their selfish political ambitions. The famous national boxing team, the “Hit Squad”, which was on top of its game, has over the years lost its allure and glory, literally becoming the punching bag of many countries. The sideshows that are going on are a bad recipe for the game, especially with the World Championships coming up late this year and the Tokyo Olympic Games due next year.
