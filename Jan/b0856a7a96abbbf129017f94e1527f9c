The High Court has ordered the preservation of properties jointly owned by Meru Senator Mithika Linturi and Marianne Kitany, pending the determination of a case she has filed. At the same time, Justice John Onyiego barred Mr Linturi from interfering with Ms Kitany’s stay at their jointly owned property in Runda, pending the hearing of the case. Among the properties the court ordered to be preserved are the Runda home, two vehicles, monies deposited in several accounts and parcels of land in Kajiado County. Justice Onyiego noted that an eviction carried out by Mr Linturi on December 19, was unlawful and meant to defeat the outcome of the case. The judge said Ms Kitany was not an ordinary visitor as alleged by Mr Linturi and her eviction was done in bad faith. The Senator had denied being married to Ms Kitany and claimed he only allowed her into the Runda house as a guest The court ordered security personnel hired by Mr Linturi at the Runda home be withdrawn and the couple to make arrangements to get joint security to man the premises.
