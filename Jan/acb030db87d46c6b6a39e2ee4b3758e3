A journalist was on Monday found dead in his home in Jogoo estate, Kisii County. Mr Johnson Nyakundi, a former cameraman for Newstar, Mwanyagetinge and Voice of Victory TV stations, was last seen before Christmas. "We are yet to know what caused his death. A neighbour was attracted by a stench coming from his house and after consulting the landlord and other guys, they decided to break in; and found his body on the bed," Mr Job Ongaga, a former colleague at Voice of Victory, said. He was living alone after separating with his wife. "When we peeped through the window, we saw a lot of blood on his bed," Mr Ongaga said. The body was taken to Kisii Teaching and Referral hospital mortuary.
