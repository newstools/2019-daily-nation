Embattled SportPesa Premier League side Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) have suspended Ezekiel Akwana and Elvis Ayany from their positions as assistant coaches after a poor start to the season. The team has conjured up just a point from their five matches, leaving them second from bottom on the league standings. Team captain Dennis Orenge has also not been spared allegedly for inciting older players against the 13 newly recruited players. “As the captain of the team, you failed in your responsibilities of uniting the team,” read part of the letter in Nation Sport’s possession and signed by club chairman Azu Ogolla. The former AFC Leopards and Sofapaka coach Akwana and Ayany were accused of sabotaging the technical bench that’s led by Frank Ouna. Akwana joined the team November last year from Nakuru All Stars following the latter’s relegation to the third tier. He was to deputize Ouna alongside Ayany - who took charge on temporary basis following the sacking of John Kamau on September 6- and successfully led the bankers to their return in the top flight after a three-year hiatus. “Our investigations have revealed that the KCB technical bench is not working as a unit which has contributed to the poor performance, it has been noted with concern that you’ve contributed to this lack of unity of purpose within the technical bench,” their letter dated January 3, 2019 read in part. “In view of the above, you are hereby suspended from the team with effect from today’s date pending further investigations into the matter.” The three are required to stay away from the KCB club premises and KCB FC team until advised otherwise. KCB, who lost 2-1 to Mathare United at Kasarani stadium in midweek, host Kariobangi Sharks on Saturday in Machakos.   He joined Leopards on a two-year deal June last year.
