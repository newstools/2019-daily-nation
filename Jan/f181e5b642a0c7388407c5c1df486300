Teachers who wish to be employed by the government have until February 12 to submit their applications. The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) is recruiting 5,000 teachers to support 100 percent transition from primary to secondary schools, a policy in its second phase. TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia said those applying for the positions must be 45 years and below and must be registered with the commission. “Applications for posts in secondary schools must be holder of a minimum of diploma in education and should apply  to the boards of management of the schools where a vacancy has been advertised and submit an application  to the TSC county director,” said Mrs Macharia. She said the commission will only deal with TSC county directors and board of management in the exercise. The recruitment of the teachers will bring to 12,000 the number of teachers recruited since last year, when the plan was rolled out. “These teachers will come in handy in supporting this policy, which ensures that all children from primary join secondary schools,” said Mrs Macharia. The recruitment is expected to cost Sh3 billion. Last month, TSC warned of a possible education crisis, unless nearly 70,000 teachers were hired to support the growing student population. Already, more than 800,000 students have reported to secondary schools. Teachers unions have also asked the government to hire more teachers, saying quality education cannot be realised when the country has a shortage of teachers. TSC had proposed that 12,626 teachers be recruited annually for four years from 2018, at a cost of Sh8.3 billion per year.
