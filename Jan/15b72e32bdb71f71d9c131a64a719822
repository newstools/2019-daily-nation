A triple header at the Camp Toyoyo grounds will be the highlight of Wednesday's National Super League (NSL) action where ten matches will be played across the country. At Toyoyo, Administration Police will be up against St Joseph’s Youth from 11am, while Kibera Black Stars take on Kenya Police in a 2pm kick-off before second-placed Wazito face Modern Coast Rangers in the last encounter from 4:15pm. The double header at the Thika Sub-county Stadium will see hosts Fortune Sacco and Thika United face off with Migori Youth and Nairobi City Stars at 2pm and 4.15pm respectively. League leaders Ushuru, who have 26 points from 10 matches, host Bidco United at Ruaraka Grounds hoping to bounce back to winning ways and stretch their lead. Cash-strapped Kangemi All Stars will be away in Kakamega to face fellow relegation candidates Green Commandos at Bukhungu Stadium, while the match between Shabana against Coast Stima has been moved to Awendo Green Stadium. The tie was earlier scheduled for Kericho Green Stadium but later shifted to Awendo since home team Zoo Kericho will be hosting AFC Leopards in a Kenyan Premier League (KPL) match at the same venue. Sitting at position 10 after five wins, a draw and four losses, Shabana - who lost to Kisumu All Stars last weekend - have been hosting their home matches at Gusii Stadium in Kisii but the ground is under renovation. The Glamour Boys assistant coach, Andrew Kanuli, said the boys are ready to play at Awendo which is not far from Kisii town. “After the controversial loss in Kisumu, the boys have vowed to fight for a win to revive our hopes of winning the league and earning promotion to the topflight,” said Kanuli.
