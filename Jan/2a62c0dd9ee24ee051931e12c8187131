Pupils in primary schools will soon start receiving anti-corruption lessons; a move aimed at instilling right values at a tender age. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) Thursday revealed that they have developed the curriculum and are only awaiting the piloting by the Education Ministry. “The curriculum is ready and just awaiting piloting,” said Mr Vincent Odongo who is the director field services at EACC. Mr Odongo made the remarks at a Nairobi hotel during a news conference convened by the multi-sectorial initiative against corruption. The multi-sectoral team agreed that it will be a good initiative to instil right values in children so that they can grow knowing that corruption is bad. This comes as the team announced that they will hold a two-day national anti-corruption conference between January 25 and 26 at Bomas of Kenya. Mr Patrick Obath, co-chairperson of the multi-sectoral team said the conference will review commitment in fight against corruption and a four-year action plan will also be launched. Nation Media Group chairman Wilfred Kiboro who represents the media fraternity in the sector forum hailed the media for being vibrant in exposing corruption. “We are not where we want to be as a country because of corruption. The fight cannot therefore be left only for the media and government, it is a duty of all citizens,” Mr Kiboro said.
