Kenyan champions Gor Mahia will depart for Limbe, Cameroon on Friday ahead of their Confederation of African Football (Caf) Confederation Cup playoff second led against New Stars de Douala of Cameroon. Gor contingent led by coach Hassan Oktay embark on a four-hour flight from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at 8.05am, before connecting to the coastal town of Limbe. The match is set for Omnisports stadium in Limbe on Sunday at 5pm. Gor, who are expected in Dar es Salaam for the 2019 SportPesa Cup on Monday morning, beat the Cameroonian outfit 2-1 in the first leg played at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani last Sunday. They will need to avoid defeat or settle for any draw to qualify for the rich group stage of this second tier interclub competition. “In West Africa anything can happen. We had a meeting with my players and I think mentally and physically we are strong enough,” the 42-year-old Turkish-Cypriot said. The 4-1 win over struggling Mount Kenya United on Wednesday did not only lift Gor to fourth position on the league standings but was a morale booster ahead of the Cameroon test. Defenders Harun Shakava and Joash Onyango, who partnered at the heart of defence in the midweek clash, are still suspended by Caf for this encounter while midfielder Humphrey Mieno signed for Ethiopian giants St. George Sports club on Monday. Gor will bank on Ugandan import Erisa Ssekisambu, who claimed Gor’s first league hat-trick on Wednesday, while Dennis Oliech, Nicholas Kipkirui and Ivorian Ephrem Guikan are ineligible for this tie as they have not been registered by the club.   He was part of a team led by award-winning journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas.
