Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has asked ward representatives to work with him in developing the county. During a tour of Machakos Level Five Hospital Tuesday, Dr Mutua who won an election petition last month, invited the representatives and other leaders to the opening of Kivandini-Masinga road Wednesday. "This is the moment wananchi should know the leaders who are pro-development," he said. The governor added that Machakos residents would soon know the political direction the region should chart. "We cannot continue suffering when Ukambani has elected leaders. We will soon tell you what the community wants," Dr Mutua said. A group of ward representatives has in the past crossed swords with the governor over development and governance matters. At one time, the county executive withheld salaries for assembly employees until the High Court and the controller of budget intervened. Dr Mutua said Machakos Level Five Hospital would soon be dealing with referral cases only to avoid congestion. He added that the number of patients at the hospital has doubled in the recent past. Dr Mutua said the hospital should ensure standards are improved and threatened to dismiss “non-performers”.   MCAs now want EACC to investigate how the monies approved by the assembly had been spent.
