Hi, Thanks for the superb work. I recently met a guy at a camp and really liked his energy and conversation. I have his number but I’m so scared of chatting him up in case he does not like me back the way I like him. There were other girls at the camp too and I’m not sure if he had romantic interest in them. What do you suggest I do?  Hi! Thanks for reading. So, if you don't text this dude, you'll be left wondering why you didn't text and inventing all sorts of scenarios and fantasies about what would have or could have happened if you did. The only person rejecting you right now is yourself, and you're not trying to date yourself. All this is to say – text the guy. You clearly want to. The other girls don't matter because you're not over here in a caucus or a panel texting him together, or relating together, or being rejected together. It's just you. If you are going to be ignored, you'll be at the exact same place you are now – but with a lot more knowledge. Do it! *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
