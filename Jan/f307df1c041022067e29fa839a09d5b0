Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria on Thursday said that his life is in danger. In a press briefing at Parliament Building, the MP said that he has reported to the DCI. Mr Kuria at the same time denied reports that he had resigned as Gatundu South MP. Some local media outlets reported Wednesday afternoon that Mr Kuria had tendered his resignation to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi.   "What The Star has done is p****** journalism. They have just reported their own things. They should get prepared for me. I am asking for damages," Mr Kuria said. During the presser Mr Kuria announced his support for the Building Bridges Initiative and apologized to President Kenyatta over his skewed development comments. He said that he has written to ODM leader Raila Odinga to launch projects in his constituency in the spirit of the ‘handshake’.
