Kenya has set its sights on India and Spain as it seeks to grow tourism numbers to 2.5 million arrivals by 2022. In a statement, the Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) said it will be leading local travel agents on marketing missions to the two countries. More than 10 Kenyan travel trade partners will pitch tent for three days starting Wednesday at the Bombay Exhibition Centre in Mumbai, India to woo travellers to Kenya at the Outbound Travel Mart (OTM). OTM is a leading travel show in the Asia-Pacific region which acts as a gateway to India’s largest travel markets. CRUCIAL MARKET KTB chief executive Betty Radier said India remains a crucial outbound market through which Kenya can continue to grow its tourism arrival figures that closed at 125,032 last year, a 6.17 percent growth compared to the previous year. India is ranked among Kenya’s top five tourists source markets from the Asian continent and is considered among the fastest growing outbound tourism travel markets, accounting for 50 million outbound tourists by 2020. Last year Kenya crossed the 2 million mark in international arrivals into the country with 2,025,206 tourists up from 1,474,671 reported in 2017, indicating a 37.33 percent growth. “India is an important market for Kenya and we have lined up other initiatives and investments that would boost brand awareness through sports such as Cricket, golf, as well as film making” said Ms Radier. She said KTB will this week be hosting Filmfare, one of the most famous Bollywood magazine for a shoot on diverse tourism products and experiences in the country presenting an opportunity for film makers to showcase Kenya as a filming destination.
