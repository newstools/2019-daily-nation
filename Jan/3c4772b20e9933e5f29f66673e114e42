Ibencho were Wednesday crowned the Bomachoge Chache tournament winners after strolling past Sengera 3-0 in the final played at Getuki grounds. Earlier at the same venue, Egetuki had beaten Riobaga 3-2 on penalties after settling for a 1-1 draw after extra time in the third place play-off. The winners bagged Sh20,000, uniform and a ball while second-placed Sengera received Sh15000, uniform and a ball. Third-placed Egetuki were awarded Sh10,000 while fourth-placed Riobaga took home Sh5,000. Over thirty teams who had participated in the tournament were given Sh3,000 each. Both sides played out to a barren draw at half time in the final attended by hundreds of sports enthusiasts in the region despite heavy rains. Justus Ontita opened the scoring for Ibencho on 55 minutes with a brilliant curler from a 20-yard freekick. Benjamin Amed and Dominic Onsabwa then scored a goal apiece in the 70th and 75th minute respectively to settle the tie as a contest. Area Member of Parliament Alpha Miruka pledged to construct two stadiums in the region in the next two years. “Our playing grounds are in an awful state but by next year I will ensure two stadiums are constructed in this region,” he said. “Moving forward this tournament will be held annually and will involve both genders, we are also thinking of doubling the awards,” added Miruka.
