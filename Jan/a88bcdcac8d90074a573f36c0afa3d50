President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM party leader Raila Odinga were among thousands of high profile guests who attended Thursday’s inauguration of DRC Congo President Felix Tshisekedi. Also in the entourage at the event held outside the People’s Palace, the seat of the Presidency, was Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Moses Cheboi and Murang’a Senator Irungu Kangata. Others were MPs Junet Mohamed (Suna East), Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay), Senators Amos Wako (Busia), Ledama Olekina (Narok) and Mr Odinga’s spokesperson Dennis Onyango. Mr Tshisekedi was declared winner of the thrice-delayed election garnering 38.5 per cent of the votes, while Martin Fayulu, who also comes from the opposition, got 34.8 per cent. Mr Fayulu who was his main competitor claimed that he won the poll with 61 per cent of the ballot, against 18 per cent each for Tshisekedi and Emmanuel Ramazani Shadari, who was Kabila's preferred candidate. Tshisekedi, 55, took over from Joseph Kabila who ruled the country for 18 years, succeeding his father Laurent-Desire, who was assassinated in 2001.   "I don't feel well," he said on live TV before halting his speech.
