Chicago Marathon champion Brigid Kosgei beat a competitive field to break a course record previously held by Mary Wacera of 66:29 to win the Aramco Houston Half Marathon in USA on Sunday. The athlete, who ran in a pack of six, increased her pace to drop her challenger Fancy Chemutai, before cutting the tape in 65:49 ahead of Chemutai, who clocked 66:47, while Ethiopia’s Ruti Aga settled for third position in 66:55. In the men’s category, New York Marathon champion Shura Kitata won the race in sprint finish after clocking 60:10 ahead of his compatriot Jemal Yimer, who timed 60:12 as Kenya's Bedan Karoki sealed the podium three in 60:16. Kosgei, fresh from winning the San Silvestre Vallecana 10km road race in Madrid, was using the race as part of her preparation for the London Marathon in April. Kosgei said that the race was tough but she had to do some good calculations to win. “I had prepared well and I had to put all my efforts to win. The weather also was cold but I’m happy I won the race,” said Kosgei.   The men’s race naturally started steadily and a large pack of 14 runners.
