Kenya Sevens chalked their first preliminary round victory this season, beating France 19-15 but the win could not prevent them from dropping to the Challenge Trophy at Hamilton Sevens, New Zealand Saturday. The team saw their poor run in the 2018/19 World Rugby Sevens Series continue when they lost to South Africa and Scotland 29-10 and 19-10 in their early Pool “C” matches. Skipper Jacob Ojee, Vincent Onyala and Daniel Taabu landed a try each for the Kenyans who led 12-5 against the French. Taabu made two conversions. Nisie Huyard, Remi Siega and Jimmy Yobo managed a try each for France but all was in vain. Tries from skipper Jacob Ojee and Cyprian Kuto failed to spur Kenya against the Series defending champions Blitzbokke as they trailed 17-5 at the break. Blitzebokke scored five penalties and two conversions. Kenya Sevens were at back foot 14-0 against Scotland at the break. Onyala and Taabu scored a try each but Kenya’s rally was an exercise in futility. Robbie Fergusson drilled down a brace for Scotland, who scored three tries and two conversions to triumph. Kenya Sevens and France was a mere formality for both teams as they cooled their heels in Challenge Trophy. Kenya Sevens are due to meet Tonga at 12.22am on Sunday while France face England at 1:06am in the Challenge Trophy quarter-finals. Argentina take on Japan at 12.00am while Spain meet Wales at 12.44am in other Challenge Trophy quarters. South Africa, who beat Scotland 26-7 in their last Pool “C” match, take on Samoa at 1.58am while Scotland is up against USA at 2.48am all in the Main Cup quarter-finals.
