BARCELONA Spanish authorities have re-opened a probe into ex-Barcelona player Eric Abidal's 2012 liver transplant after confirming that new evidence had come to light suggesting a trafficked organ was used, according to a legal decision seen by AFP. Courts have previously investigated the transplant on Abidal, who was then stricken with cancer, because of doubts about the identity of the donor.
