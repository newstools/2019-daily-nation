Leaders Ushuru beat Bidco United 2-0 at Ruaraka grounds on Wednesday to tighten their grip on the summit of the National Super League (NSL). The win, which is Ushuru’s ninth of the season, saw Ken Kenyatta's increase their tally to 29 points from 11 matches, two points above second-placed Wazito who edged out Modern Coast Rangers 2-1 at Camp Toyoyo. Oscar Mbugua was on target for the taxmen in the first minute after meeting Alex Sunga's cross before Brian Yahama swiftly lobbed the ball over goalkeeper Daniel Guoma to double their advantage on 34 minutes. Bidco players protested what they claimed was a clear penalty 11 minutes from time when Emmanuel Onyancha was felled in the box. “Despite the poor officiating, we started the match badly conceding early goals. It’s not always easy to come back from two early goals, but I thank the boys for fighting hard especially in the second half. We now focus on our next match against Kisumu All Stars,” said Bidco coach Anthony Akhulia. Kenyatta said: “It was a tough match, but I’m happy we won. We are now concentrating on the next match against FC Talanta.” In Kakamega, hosts Green Commandos hit Kangemi All Stars 2-0 at Bukhungu Stadium through goals scored by Enock Ojwang and Harrison Omutuku.
