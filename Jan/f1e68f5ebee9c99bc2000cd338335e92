World Cross Country champion Geoffrey Kamworor Saturday edged out Josphat Boit in a thrilling exchange in the last lap to win his sixth Kenya Police Service Cross Country Championships men's 10km title at Ngong racecourse on Saturday. Unlike previous editions where Kamworor took a trailblazing show from the first lap, he stayed in a pack of four athletes into the fourth lap. Kamworor, Boit, Isaac Kwemoi and Matthew Kisorio stayed neck-to-neck in a pulsating battle before Boit and Kamworor dropped the rest into the final lap. Then Kamworor would glide past Boit into the last kilometre before winning in 29 minutes and 36.1 seconds. Boit finished second in 29:53.9, his best ever show after finishing 26th in 2017 and 34th last year. Kwemoi timed 29:58.8 for third place as Emmanuel Bett And Kisorio followed in fourth and fifth in 30:04.9 and 30:08.7 respectively. "I enjoy fast championships where the battle goes down to the wire. I was used to going alone right from the first lap but competition was right this time around," said Kamworor, who is eager to defend his National title before going for his third successive World title in March 30 in Aarhus, Denmark. Kamworor won back-to-back from 2013 to 2016, failed to defend in 2017 but has now won three in a row. Boit said Kamworor had a psychological edge that worked for him. "I wasn't prepared for the mental battle with Kamworor. He is just good at it, " said Boit.   Margaret Chelimo finished first ahead of Hyvin Kiyeng.
