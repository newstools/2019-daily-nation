The government has invited local and foreign mass housing enterprises to invest in low-cost housing development. Housing and Urban Development principal secretary Charles Hinga said applicants seeking to partner with the government have under a month to file bids starting last Monday for Lot 1A, Lot 1B and Lot 1C. Interested strategic partners for the Affordable Housing Programme (AHP) will make online submissions within the next one month,” the PS said. The three selected lots will pioneer re-development of government-owned residential estates from single dwellings to multi-storeyed apartments starting with Nairobi’s Park Road estate and spread to 36 counties that committed to providing land for the project. The flagship projects include Park Road estate where 1,640 housing units will be built, Starehe (3,500), Shauri Moyo (5,300), Social housing (15,000) and Mavoko with 5,500 units. Participating county governments will see 48,000 units built with Nairobi and Mombasa cities taking up the bulk. The nationwide programme will be rolled out in the next three years where 7,000 acres of public land has been reserved. Employers and workers have gone to court, opposing the the AHP programme that is pinned on a 1.5 per cent monthly deduction on pay. Employers are expected to match the amounts deducted but they have said the deductions will hurt their profits while unions cited heavy taxation.
