Mathare United coach Francis Kimanzi has lauded Kariobangi Sharks after their goalless draw in the fifth Slum derby at Kasarani stadium on Wednesday. Both teams displayed entertaining football patiently building from the back by stringing precise passes in both halves. “This was the second game that I’ve seen a team that wants to play football, they build up thinking and have a strategy to work on for 90 minutes,” admitted Kimanzi. “I’ve witnessed games whereby you play football with a team just waiting for you to lose the ball so that they can pounce on a counter,” added the Harambee Stars assistant coach. “I try to concentrate on my team to improve in terms of the technical and tactical aspect, but against Sharks, we were not explosive enough partly because we didn’t have the energy after playing on Sunday, but I’ve to compliment the character from my boys.” A point took their tally to 24 points, opening a six-point gap between them and second-placed Bandari, who lost 4-0 to Kakamega Homeboyz at Bukhungu stadium. “It’s a point gained if you look at the load the players had to go through 72 hours after the match on Sunday (against Vihiga United). The quality of the opponent also who looked motivated after winning the tournament in Tanzania hence making it difficult for us,” offered Kimanzi. On the title charge? “Every team after round 10 has some opportunity to win the league, it’s a long way we just have to utilize our chances but there’s also pressure when you are topping the table but we take a game at a time.” The 2008 champions visit Mount Kenya United at Afraha stadium in Nakuru on Saturday.   Mathare United maintain their top spot on the log with 24 points.
