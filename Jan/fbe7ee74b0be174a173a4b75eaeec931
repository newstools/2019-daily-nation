Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has criticised the Council of Governors after it ignored a deal made in 2017 to have him succeed Josphat Nanok. The gentleman’s agreement stipulated that Mr Mvurya would take over form the Turkana governor after six months and be deputised by Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. But the CoG ignored the agreement that had been made public and conducted elections on Monday in which Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya clinched the chairmanship to be deputised by Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria. Addressing journalists outside his office on Tuesday after a closed-door meeting with Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala, Mr Mvurya CoG should have adhered to that 2017 deal. "I did not participate in the election because I was not happy on how the CoG vacated the position and that put to question the integrity of the council," he said. NEW CHAIRMAN During Monday's polls, Kakamega Governor Wicliffe Oparanya was elected the fourth CoG boss, replacing Mr Nanok. Other previous holders of the seat are former Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto and former Meru Governor Peter Munya. During a CoG meeting in Kwale in December 2017, the top Jubilee leadership had favoured Mr Mvurya to take over from Mr Nanok following bruising encounters with their predecessors. Mr Mvurya is a close ally of President Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto.   Prevailing political situation makes Monday's election unique as ODM cosies up to Jubilee Party.
