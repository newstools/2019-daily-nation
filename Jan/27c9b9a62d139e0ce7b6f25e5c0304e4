Detectives from the anti-graft agency arrested Isiolo Administration Police (AP) commander Michael Kioko Kaitha and his driver after the vehicle they were in was found loaded with 100 litres of petrol. According to police reports, the AP commander was arrested by Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission (EACC) officers in Isiolo on Friday alongside his driver, an AP sergeant identified as James Mithainga, in a government-issue Isuzu double-cabin pickup truck. The two officers, who were apprehended at a roadblock along the Isiolo International Airport-Isiolo town junction, were each released on Sh50,000 cash bail pending investigations. The report indicated that the two officers were arrested for offence of abuse of office. The EACC detectives also found animal feeds and saw dust believed to have been destined for Nairobi during the 17.30pm incident. It is suspected that the AP boss was en route to his home for a weekend. It is not clear when the officer will be arraigned. EACC Upper Eastern regional manager Faith Ngethe declined to confirm the arrest saying she is not authorised to speak to the press.
