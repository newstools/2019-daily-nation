Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has unveiled a strategic plan that will see a 100 percent transition rate of students from secondary schools to colleges. The five-year plan seeks to turn around the education sector in the vast semi-arid county by increasing literacy levels and equipping the youth with technical skills. Mr Muriithi announced this when he spoke on Monday at the County Assembly Hall during the launch of the plan. MENTORSHIP He also rolled out a mentorship programme for primary and secondary school students. The programme will be spearheaded by professionals drawn from the county and Laikipia University students. “We are creating a new awakening, a new purpose. There is an amazing opportunity for our universities to expand their involvement in education,” Governor Muriithi said. This week leaders, professionals and alumni of various schools will be meeting parents, learners in every wards to discuss education issues such as enrolment to vocational training centres, technical schools and universities. ILLITERACY Mr Muriithi said some areas of the county have “unacceptable” rates of illiteracy and urged Laikipia University to focus more on adult education.
