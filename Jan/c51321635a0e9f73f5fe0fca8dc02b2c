Nzoia Sugar Company Managing Director Michael Kulundu is nursing injuries at the Bungoma West Hospital after he was allegedly kidnapped by unknown people last evening around 8:30pm. Mr Kulundu is said to have been at the Salmond Restaurant located on the Kanduyi-Sikata highway when he was kidnapped. His family found him in a trench near Gulf Petrol station, about 100 metres, from the restaurant he was grabbed from after searching for him overnight. Bungoma South OCPD Patrick Nyangares, who confirmed the incident, said they have launched investigations. "We are currently recording statements from his family members and I want to assure everyone we will bring the culprits to book," said Mr Nyangares, who was accompanied by the county police commander Francis Sang. INJURED A family member told the Nation that they found him in a trench after searching for him overnight. "When he failed to come home last evening, we mounted a search for him. Our main focus was where he was last seen. It was not until around 5am that we found him in a trench near the road," the family member said. He said that the alleged kidnappers used a razor blade to cut his right hand fingers. "We also suspect that he was sedated by his tormentors before he was taken away," said the family member. According to the hospital administrator Denis Sande, Mr Kulundu was brought to the facility on Thursday morning by his driver. "At around 7am, we received a male patient by the name Michael Kulundu who happens to be the MD Nzoia Sugar Company. He had suffered multiple cut wounds on the head, right hand, chest and lower limps," Mr Sande said. He added: "We have conducted X-rays, CT scans and we can confirm that he is in stable condition because there were no internal injuries."
