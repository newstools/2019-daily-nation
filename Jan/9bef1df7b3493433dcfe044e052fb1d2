Kenya Commercial Bank's (KCB) winger Jacob Ojee is the new Kenya Sevens skipper. The 27-year-old, who is making a return to Kenya Sevens for the first time since 2014, will now lead the team for the next legs of the 2018/2019 World Rugby Sevens Series in Hamilton Sevens due January 26 and 27 in New Zealand and Sydney Sevens on February 2 and 3 In Australia. Ojee, a former Kisumu Rugby player, replaces Eden Agero, who led the team in the opening legs of the Series in Dubai and Cape Town. Agero is among several senior players who boycotted national team training owing to pay dispute. Ojee will be deputised by Homeboyz scrum-half Michael Wanjala in the 13-man squad that has five rookies. "This is a good challenge for me but I believe the young squad will deliver if they focus," said Ojee. "We just need to defend well and get out set pieces right." Ojee last played for Kenya Sevens in the Gold Coast  and Port Elizabeth legs of the 2014 Series under coach Paul Treu. While appointing Ojee, head coach Paul "Pau" Murunga said that the player has the qualities to lead the team. "Ojee has been amazing during the team training. He ensured all players communicated well and his experience from the 15s version of the game will be key," said Murunga. Among the rookies in the team are former Kenya  Under-19 captain Harold Anduvate, Brian Wandera, Eliakim Kichoi, William Reeves and Mark Wandetto.
