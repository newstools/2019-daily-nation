Police in Suba North, Homa Bay County have arrested two Tanzanians who were trafficking bhang worth Sh0.5 million on Remba Island in Lake Victoria. The drugs which weighed 40kg were packed in four sacks. The suspects, who were identified as Mr Jackson Josephat, 20, and a woman identified as Ms Annah Mwisawa, 34, were arrested on Tuesday evening by Administration Police (AP) officers who were on patrol on the lake. Suba North Deputy AP Commander Elias Wasonga said his officers arrested the two following a tip off from concerned members of the public. FISHING BOAT "We were informed that the suspects were transporting the drugs on a fishing boat from Tanzania. Their destination was Remba Island," he said. Mr Wasonga said his officers trailed the suspects to a rental house within the island. "At first they tried to escape when they were confronted. However, the officers managed to arrest them after they offloaded the drugs on the island," said the officer.
