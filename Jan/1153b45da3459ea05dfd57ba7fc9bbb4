The National Land Commission (NLC) has revoked 25 title deeds of nine Islands owned by private developers in Kwale County. Speaking in Bodo village on Saturday, NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri said the islands were acquired illegally and fraudulently allocated to individuals. The islands include Funzi, Shirazi, Bodo and others in Msambweni Sub-county. "We have taken bold steps to reposes all public land allocated to private developers," Mr Swazuri noted. "The deeds were revoked following the decision by the court that the nine islands are public land. Those claiming ownership are cheating themselves for they cannot use the documents to claim ownership," he added. The commission gave the land owners until February 20 to surrender the titles. Mr Swazuri further issued a 90-days for the people to vacate the land, urging security officers to ensure the order is adhered to and locals allowed to own the property. He reiterated the commission's commitment to ending perennial land woes in the county.    Suspicions abound about Hamisi Mwatende, 82, 'lost' his land to Alessandro Torriani.
