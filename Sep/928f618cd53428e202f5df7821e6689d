Kenya’s Elijah Manang'oi will not defend his World 1,5000m title. Making the announcement on his official Facebook page on Monday, the 26-year-old Manang’oi said an ankle injury he picked in training has locked him out of the World Championships that will be held from September 27 to October 6 this year. “Sad that I am not able to defend my 1,500m title in Doha WC due to an ankle injury I picked in training. I have no choice,” said Manang'oi, adding that he will now have to work on rehabilitation before turning his focus to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. “It’s only God who knows why but I want all my fans across the World to continue having faith in me,” added Manang'oi, who took his time to wish his team mates best of luck in the metric mile race in Doha. Those in the 1,500m team are World Under-20 1,500m champion George Manang'oi, who is his younger brother and World and Commonwealth 1,500m silver medallist Timothy Cheruiyot. Also in the team is the 2014 Africa 1,500m bronze medallist Ronald Kwemoi, who is making a return to the team after long lay-off, having lost in the semi-finals of the 1,500m during the 2017 World Championships in  London. Kenya had the privilege of fielding four athletes by virtue of having a defending champion Elijah Manang'oi and Cheruiyot, the Diamond League Series winner. The 2016 World Under-20 1,500m Kumari Taki could be picked by Athletics Kenya for the Doha event after finishing fourth during the trials last weekend. It will be Cheruiyot’s third appearance at the World Championships, having settled for seventh place in the 2015 edition held in Beijing, before going for silver at the 2017 showpiece in London, losing the battle to Elijah. George, who is also the 2017 World Under-18 1,500m champion, will be making his debut, while Kwemoi, the 2014 Commonwealth Games 1,500m silver medallist, will be making his second appearance.
