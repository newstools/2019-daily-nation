Kirinyaga County Commissioner Jim Njoka has ordered a crackdown on miraa vehicles breaking traffic rules. He lamented that vehicles transporting miraa to Nairobi from Meru and Embu are often being involved in fatal crashes along roads in Kirinyaga, mainly due to speeding and told the police to implement his directive without delay. Mr Njoka warned that reckless drivers will be arrested and prosecuted. "The operators are dangerously driving their vehicles while on their way to the city and the police should rein them in," he told residents while speaking in Kiandieri village. DEATHS ON THE ROAD He noted that several residents had been crushed to death and others injured by miraa vehicles and told the police to deal ruthlessly with the drivers. He said the drivers should be arrested and their vehicles detained at local police stations until the traffic cases are heard and determined. "Police should ensure that the vehicles involved in accidents are not released to the owners when cases are going on in courts" he said. The directive comes barely five days after four people, among them two boda boda riders, were killed in separate road crashes in the region. Mr Njoka said the government is determined to protect the lives of the residents.
