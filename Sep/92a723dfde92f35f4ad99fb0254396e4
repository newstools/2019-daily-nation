A 73-year-old former Treasury employee and her 47 year old daughter were Monday night found murdered in their house in Nairobi’s South B Estate. The bodies of Judith Mwai and Catherine Nyaguthie Mwai were found in separate rooms in their Golden Gate home, both bearing strangulation marks. Police said the bodies were discovered by the Mrs Mwai’s sister, Peris Wambui Kimani who had visited the home at around 3.30pm. “The bodies of mother and daughter lay in separate rooms…upstairs…The body of Mrs Judith was found on her bed facing down with a sisal rope around her neck tied on a bed stand and blood oozing from her mouth. “The body of her daughter Catherine Nyaguthie was found lying on the floor of her bedroom with injury marks around her neck which pointed to a possible strangulation,” police said on Tuesday. ONLY OCCUPANTS Reports indicate that the two were the only occupants of the house with two tenants living in servant quarters in the same compound. The night guard, who recorded a statement with the Makadara Police, said he had not seen the two since Sunday when they were dropped at home by a black vehicle. Preliminary police investigations show that nothing was stolen from the house that the two have been living in. By Tuesday morning, police were still interrogating tenants, the watchman and Ms Mwai’s relatives to try and find out who may have murdered the two. The bodies were taken the Chiromo Mortuary.
