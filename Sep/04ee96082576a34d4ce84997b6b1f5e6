Handicap 13 Kepha Bosire overpowered a big field of 188 golfers to claim the 2019 Muthoni Muthiga Trophy at the par 72 Vet Lab Sports Club course on Saturday. Bosire, former Director of Corporate Communication at Kenya Commercial Bank whose handicap was later chopped to 12, did not, however, start the day well as he pushed his driver to the right side trees on the first hole. He tried to hit a low cut but ended in the fairway bunker, eventually reaching the green on four. He three putted, to scratch it with an awful nine. This was followed by a bogey at the second, fourth, fifth and a double at the seventh and closed the first nine with a birdie at the ninth for 17 points. At the back nine, Bosire dropped shots at the 12th, 13th and 15th but parred the rest for an impressive 22 points, to beat men winner Eddy Mogoa, Chrispin Owuor and third placed man Peter Njuguna on countback. “It has been a while since I won any event at Vet Lab, but thanks to the back nine which saw me emerge the winner,’’ said Bosire.
