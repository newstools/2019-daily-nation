Four people, among them two brothers, have been killed by unknown assailants in Tana Delta, Tana River County. The four were reportedly shot dead before being torched, burning beyond recognition by their attackers. The brothers have been identified as Hussein Ali, 30 and 37-years-old Mustafa Ali alias China. Others killed in the incident were long distance truck drivers whose identities are yet to be established. The brothers' uncle Abubakar Abdi said bodies of his kin were found in an iron-sheet house together with the two others where they were torched. GRUESOME ATTACK “They have been torched beyond recognition. We are yet to know who are behind this heinous attack,” Mr Abdi said in pain. He said the two drivers were at a restaurant where Mr Mustafa sells tea. The hotel is located along the Garsen-Garissa highway. According to Mnazini Chief Mohammed Dubat, the two brothers were closing business when they were attacked. Mr Hussein is a herdsman within the Tana Delta, according to his relatives who are struggling to come to terms with the incident. “The two drivers had met at the hotel where they were talking about the condition of the road as one was heading to Mombasa and another to Garissa only to be attacked and killed,” said a Kenya Red Cross Society official who requested anonymity. POLICE OFFICERS Community policing sources within the area said the incident happened at around midnight. It is reported that the four were taken 50 metres away from the hotel that they were in and locked in the iron sheet house before being set ablaze. Locals who had been given a ride in one of the trucks said the men who took the victims away had identified themselves as police officers. “They came and asked for our ID cards after identifying themselves as officers before whisking the four away,” said one of the locals who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons. Police said they have launched investigations into the incident.
