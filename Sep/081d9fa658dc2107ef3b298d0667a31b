Kenyan Premier League side Bandari are on the brink of qualifying for the group stages of the Caf Confederation Cup after a 3-2 aggregate win against Tunisia's US Ben Guerdane. Bandari lost 2-1 in the return leg of the their first round clash away on Sunday, but their 2-0 win at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani in the first leg proved in handy. They will now need to win a two-legged playoff to qualify for the group stages of Africa's second football tier competition. The draws will be conducted in Cairo on Wednesday. Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) Head of Corporate Affairs Bernard Osoro expressed his joy with the result saying its good not just for the Mombasa-based club, but for football in the whole region. “We are now representing East Africa in the playoff stage and that means a lot. It was a very tough match but what matters is we are through to the next stage. The whole team is very happy and motivated. We aim to go as far as possible in continental football this season,” Osoro told Nation Sport from Tunisia on Sunday. At the Ben Guerdane stadium, the Dockers found themselves chasing the game as early as in the fourth minute following an early goal by Ricardo Alves and he doubled his side's lead in the 21st minute. Alves could have grabbed a hat trick in the 64th minute, but Bandari custodian Michael Wanyika denied him from the spot. Cliff Kasuti made a good run on the right flank and released a perfect cross into the box which Ugandan international William Wadri thumped in to hand Bandari a lifeline in the 89th minute.
