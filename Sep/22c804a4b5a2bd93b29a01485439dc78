Thirdway Alliance Party leader Ekuru Aukot’s Punguza Mizigo bill has been rejected by the Nyamira County Assembly. The bill was tabled before the House by Majority Leader Duke Masira and it flopped on a technicality after Bomwagamo Ward Rep Charles Barongo failed to second it. A similar scenario was experienced in Kirinyaga but a voter has sued the Kirinyaga County Assembly seeking to have it compelled to reintroduce the Punguza Mizigo Referendum (Constitution Amendment Bill) for debate and voting. According to House Standing Orders, if a bill lacks a seconder it stands suspended for six months when it’s supposed to be re-tabled in the Assembly. Mr Masira said the Bill has several gaps among them reduction of constituencies which he said would eventually affect wards. "I introduced the bill and it wasn't seconded. As per the law, it can only be introduced again after six months. This technically means we have rejected it since they have until next month to have it passed," he said. Nominated MCA Innocent Mose lauded the development, adding that the bill had no space in the assembly. Already, Siaya, Homa Bay and Murang'a counties have debated the bill and rejected it. Only Uasin Gishu County has passed it. The proposed law, which is sponsored by the Thirdway Alliance party, aims to make changes, including reducing Parliament’s annual budget from Sh36.8 billion to Sh5 billion, reducing the number of Members of Parliament from 416 to 147 and introducing a seven-year one-term presidency. At least 24 county assemblies should approve the bill for it to move to the National Assembly and the Senate for approval. If the majority of the MPs in the Houses support it, it will be presented to the President for assent.
