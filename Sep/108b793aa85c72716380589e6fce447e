Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi announced late Tuesday afternoon the start of a formal impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump in the US House of Representatives. Speaker Pelosi said the President must be held accountable over claims he sought help from Ukraine for political gain. "This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically," Ms Pelosi said. "The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonourable facts of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections." President Trump is alleged to have pressured Ukraine's leader to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. The announcement of the formal impeachment inquiry marks the first step in a process that could ultimately lead to Trump's removal from office. More follows
