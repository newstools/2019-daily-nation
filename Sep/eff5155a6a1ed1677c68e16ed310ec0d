Property of unknown value was destroyed at the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC), Kisumu office on Saturday afternoon. The Western Region Chief Security Officer Mr Zachary Ombati said officers on duty informed him that there was a fire outbreak at the Information and Communication Technology server room. He said that the fire did not spread to other offices as the fire brigade swiftly responded and put off the inferno 45 minutes later. “The server room holds machines worth Sh10 million. We are yet to know if all the machines were destroyed,” said Mr Ombati. The chief security officer also stated that the cause of fire was yet to be established. “We suspect an electric fault as the room was locked and no one was around when the fire started,” he said. No injuries were reported during the incident.
