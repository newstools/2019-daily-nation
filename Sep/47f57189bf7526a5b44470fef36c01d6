IN DOHA Kenya's Agnes Tirop settled for bronze in the women's 10,000m final in the Doha World Championships as Ethiopian-born Dutch runner Sifan Hassan won gold at the Khalifa Stadium on Saturday. This was Hassan's first ever global outdoor title and she did it in style - winning in the fastest time this year of 30min 17.62sec.     The 26-year-old outsprinted Ethiopia's Letesenbet Gidey who timed 30:21.23. Tirop settled for bronze in 30:25.20.   Kenya's 5,000m World champion Hellen Obiri, one of the pre-race favourites with defending champion Almaz Ayana of Ethiopia out, finished fifth behind compatriot Rosemary Wanjiru.
