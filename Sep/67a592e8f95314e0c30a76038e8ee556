Police in Imenti North, Meru County, have forwarded for identification the fingerprints and blood samples of a man whose mutilated body was found dumped in Lower Imenti forest last week. The body was found on a pathway, with white socks on the feet and underwear. There were no shoes and other clothes in sight. Imenti North DCIO James Githinji said a blood-stained panga they believe was used to kill the person was found nearby. The panga was dusted for finger prints and samples of the blood taken for DNA tests. NO IDENTIFICATION Mr Githinji said they hoped the identity of the man is established in the Registrar of Persons database. He said they believed he was in his mid 30s. â€œThe man was of fair complexion but had no identification documents or phone. The amount [of blood at the scene] was small so it is likely that he was killed elsewhere," he said, noting there was so sign of a struggle. The body was taken to the Meru Level Five Hospital mortuary.
