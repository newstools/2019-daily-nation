Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot suffered yet another blow following the rejection of his Punguza Mizigo bill by the Kisii County Assembly on Thursday. Kisii became the seventh assembly to trash the bill which if passed will set the country on a referendum path. The bill was on Thursday evening debated in the chamber and not a single member endorsed it. Before the rejection, Sensi Ward Rep Paul Angwenyi, who moved the motion, told the house that by passing it, "we will take away the gains that this country has made." "Passing the bill will take away all the nine constituencies in Kisii county, leaving us with only nine Wards and majority of our women will go back home as housewives," he pointed out. He added, "all our 24 nominated members whom we've enjoyed their comfort and way of thinking will go home. That will be demeaning." MCA Protus Moindi said, "we are not only supposed to reject this bill but to kill it and condemn it's promoter completely."
