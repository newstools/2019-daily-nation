The national women's volleyball team is not new to success. The team has won a record nine African titles and recently retained their African Games gold in Morocco. Long before the team was christened Malkia Strikers, the sport had already its share of legends. Kenya made it to the 2000 Sydney and 2004 Athens Olympic Games, but subsequent attempts to qualify for the Games from then have only brought heartache to Kenyans. Kenya finished 11th in the 2004 Games. The African qualifiers for the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games will be held at a yet to be decided date and venue in January next year, where Malkia Strikers will be hoping to snatch the lone slot the continent is reserved for in the Games after missing out on the 2008 (Beijing), 2012 (London) and 2016 (Rio) events. Nation Sport takes a look at the heroines who represented the country at the 2000 Games: Squad Mary Ayuma, Violet Barasa, Ednah Chepngeno, Margaret Indakhala, Jackline Makokha, Roselidah Obunaka, Gladys Nasikanda, Dorcas Ndasaba, Judith Serenge, Doris Wefwafwa and Emily Wesutila Head Coach: Gilbert Ohanya Assistant coach: Paul Gitau Ohanya Nicknamed Fabisch after the late Reinhardt Fabisch who transformed the national men football team, Harambee Stars, to a decent side in the late 90s, Ohanya is remembered as the first coach to guide the Kenyan women volleyball team to the Olympics in 2000. He coached Telkom and Kenya Pipeline at club level where he achieved big success in African Club Championships before retiring to his rural home in Ugunja where he led Ambira High School to the nationals on several occasions. He also coached men's side Mombasa Telkom and the men's national team in the early 80s. Ohanya passed away on September 14 this year after losing a long battle to prostate cancer. His burial is slated for October 5.   Gitau Unlike the joyful and ever-smiling Ohanya, Gitau - his assistant - was a no-nonsense coach. A former Nyeri Posta setter, Gitau honed his coaching skills under the guidance of Ohanya and remains one of the most successful but uncelebrated coaches in the country. Besides coaching local sides like KCB and Telkom, Gitau is best remembered as the only Kenyan coach to have won two All African Games titles. He won the 1999 edition held in Johannesburg and his latest success was guiding Kenya's Under-23 team to gold in Congo Brazzaville in 2015.
