The Kenya Women Teachers Association (Kewota) has termed the assault on Everlyn Otieno, 25, as she taught at St Paul’s Gulf Academy as barbaric, inhuman and traumatising to teachers and pupils.

Mrs Otieno, a mother of two, was treated and discharged from Bondo Sub-County Hospital. She said that her husband had threatened to kill her on several occasions. Kewota Chairperson Dorothy Muthoni on Friday called on police and state prosecutors to take action against Mr Ochieng, who is said to have been arrested but later was released under unclear circumstances.

This incident comes barely a week after another female teacher was found murdered by unknown people in Kisumu. Her husband is among those suspected to have had a hand in the brutal attack. The Kewota chairperson called on Teachers Service Commission to ensure the safety of teachers in schools. “Murder cases involving women teachers is on the rise and women teachers should take utmost precaution when signs of domestic violence start showing before they turn tragic,” she added.
