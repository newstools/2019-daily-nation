LONDON Liverpool will host Arsenal and Chelsea face Manchester United in two blockbuster League Cup fourth round ties. Wednesday's draw for the last 16 produced two eye-catching ties as Jurgen Klopp's Premier League leaders take on the Gunners at Anfield and struggling United head to Stamford Bridge. Liverpool, who have won the competition a record eight times, beat Milton Keynes Dons 2-0 to reach the fourth round, while Arsenal thrashed Nottingham Forest 5-0. United, who last won the League Cup in 2017, needed a 5-3 penalty shoot-out victory over third tier Rochdale to limp through after a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. In contrast to United's latest disjointed effort, last season's runners-up Chelsea hammered Grimsby 7-1. Southampton's prize for a first win at local rivals Portsmouth in 35 years is a trip to holders Manchester City. There were also all-Premier League ties between Everton and Watford and Aston Villa and Wolves. The two lowest-ranked sides left in the competition, fourth tier pair Crawley and Colchester, were drawn together. Leicester will travel to Burton, while in an all-League One clash Oxford will host Sunderland. Fourth round draw Everton v Watford Manchester City v Southampton Crawley v Colchester Oxford v Sunderland Aston Villa v Wolves Burton v Leicester Chelsea v Manchester United Liverpool v Arsenal Ties to be played in the week beginning October 28.
