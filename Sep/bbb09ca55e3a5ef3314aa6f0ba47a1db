Health workers in Kisumu County on Thursday evening suspended their three-week strike. The over 7,000 health workers are expected to resume work on Friday following successful talks with the county government that led to the signing of a return-to-work agreement on Thursday. Speaking to Nation, the Kenya Union of Clinical Officer Kisumu branch secretary Craus Okumu said they had suspended the strike to allow the county meet their demands as agreed in Thursday's deal. “We have put on hold the strike for three months to see if the county can hold their end of the bargain, which I hope they do,” said Mr Okumu. He however added, “after the expiry of the suspension period, the nurses will be at liberty to commence another strike if the agreement is not met.” The health workers and the county had agreed on important issues raised during the strike including the payment of salaries, statutory deductions. “…. that the employer shall settle all pending salaries for the months of July, August and September by October 4 and that beginning October 1 the county government shall pay monthly salaries not later that 5th of every preceding month,” read the agreement. The county has also pledged to settle all pending loan remissions to respective financial institutions including banks and insurance companies by Friday next week. In the agreement signed by the County secretary Mr Godfrey Kigochi and the chief officer of Health Mr Dickens Onyango, they settled at issuing re-designation letters to names of workers forwarded by their unions by December 30. They also vowed to review and promote workers whose names had been submitted to the employer by December 31.
