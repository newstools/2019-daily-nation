Business came to a standstill in Kiminini, Trans Nzoia on Friday afternoon as police clashed with locals who were demanding for justice after three women were allegedly raped by police reservists. The locals, who barricaded the Kitale-Webuye highway at Kiminini market, were enraged after officers at the Kiminini Police Station released the three suspects linked to the crimes without taking them to court. “We are demanding for justice because police failed to charge the suspects as required by law,” said Richard Situma, a resident. One of the victims claimed three armed police reservists broke in to her home in Masaba at around 2am on September 4 and raped her in the presence of her husband and children. “They got into the house after breaking one of the windows and told my husband to keep quiet or else they will kill all of us," the woman said. She said the armed men stole some household goods. She said she reported at the Kiminini Police Station. “My husband had recognised the face of one of the police reservists he is popular in this area," the woman said. Two women are also reported to have been raped by the same suspects but efforts to have them held accountable have borne no fruits. A police source, who did not want to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the press, told the Nation that investigators narrowed on the three police reservists but the case was bungled up following interference by some senior police officers. Residents called on the Trans Nzoia County commissioner to ensure the alleged suspects face justice.
