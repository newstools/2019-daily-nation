IN DOHA The Kenyan trio of Emmanuel Korir, Ferguson Rotich and Kipngetich Ng'eno sailed into the semi-finals of the men's 800m after winning their respective heats in the two-lap race in the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha on Saturday. Ng'eno, who finished second in the Kenyan trials for the Worlds, was the first on the track of the three Kenyans in Heat 2 which he won in 1:46.07 ahead of Spaniard Adrián Ben (1:46.12) and Great Britain's Adam Webb (1:46.23) to all seal the three automatic qualifying slots. Fourth placed Brannon Kidder from the US sneaked through as one of the best losers. Korir had the fastest time in the qualifying rounds of 1:45.16, with Morocco's Mostafa Smaili (1:45.27) and Puerto Rico's Wesley Vázquez (1:45.47) coming home second and third respectively. At the same time, the withdrawal of race favourite and multiple Diamond League champion Nigel Amos of Botswana through injury has thrown the race wide open. The 2012 Olympic Games 800m silver medallist Amos, who was scheduled to run in the second heat at Khalifa Stadium, did not start. The heat was won by Kipng'etich in a time of 1 minute, 46.07 seconds, followed by Spain's Adrian Ben in 1:46.12 and Great Britains Jammie Webb (1:46.23). Rotich won the fourth heat in 1:45.98, to qualify alongside second-placed American Bryce Hopel (1:46.01) and Tunisia's Abdessalem Ayouni (1:46.09). "Today's race was good. Our aim was to qualify for the semis, which we have done comfortably. We now wait for tomorrow's semi-finals. We will work with the coaches to come up with a game plan to see us through to the final," Rotich said. Korir easily won the fifth heat in a time of 1:45.16 to qualify alongside second-placed Smaili (1:45.27) and third-placed Vasquez. The top three athletes from the six heats qualified for Sunday's semi-finals alongside the next six fastest athletes.
