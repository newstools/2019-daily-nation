The burial of murdered Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen has been postponed to Tuesday. The ceremony was initially planned for Monday afternoon at the Jewish Cemetery on Prof Wangari Mathai Road in Nairobi. The burial planners said they only managed to get eight Jewish priests, instead of the required 10, hence they decided to postpone the burial to Tuesday at 2.30pm.   Cohen’s family’s lawyers Mr Danstan Omari and Mr Cliff Ombetta explained that owing to Cohen’s high religious standing in the Jewish community, additional two priests will needed to enable a complete burial process. Mr Ombetta assured the defense team that the burial shall not be conducted until Tuesday 2:30pm. He said the ceremony shall proceed without Cohen’s sister Gabrielle Van Straten who travelled back home on Friday night. “Cohen’s brother Bernard is here and he shall be in charge of the burial but Gabrielle remains the family spokesperson,” said Mr Ombetta.    Cohen's widow Sarah Wairimu had Monday arrived for the private ceremony which was to be attended by a few family members. The media was barred from the event. She was escorted to the cemetery by a contingent of prison warders and armed regular police officers who kept watch of the venue as a group of young men dug Cohen's grave.    Ms Wairimu’s lawyer Philip Murgor said he shall go back to the court to get consent for his client to attend the Tuesday burial. “We have to wait until tomorrow (Tuesday). We are sorry for the inconvenience but sometimes when fate comes in, we cannot over ride it. The preparations for Cohen’s grave, which began on Monday afternoon, shall continue on Tuesday.
