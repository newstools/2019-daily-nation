Transport on the Kisii-Kisumu highway was on Friday paralysed after floods rendered a section of the road, which is under construction, impassable. Some vehicles were swept off the road at Kodada trading centre in Rachuonyo East sub county. Some of the travellers blamed the Chinese company constructing the road. “Some sections of the road have rivers whose water flow from the highlands to Lake Victoria, the contractor should have made larger waterways to allow smooth flow of water," said Mr Samuel Owida.   Most vehicles from Nairobi, which operated between Oyugis and Katito via Sondu town, are now using the Kosele-Kendu Bay road. Rachuonyo East Police Commander Charles Barasa said the area will continue to experience floods due to the ongoing rains. “I urge road users to be careful and keep off flooded sections of the road,” he said. The officer added that no casualties have been reported.
