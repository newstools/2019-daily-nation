Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen may miss the week-long Senate sittings in Kitui after suffering a dislocated shoulder during a football match on Monday evening. Mr Murkomen was transferred to The Nairobi Hospital for specialised treatment after receiving first aid at Neema hospital in Kitui Town. Doctors have said he needed to undergo a minor surgery to correct his dislocated shoulder. He suffered the injury during a friendly match between the Senate and the County Assembly of Kitui, at Ithookwe showground. The senatorâ€™s injury disrupted the match for about 15 minutes as he received medical attention. The Senate, dubbed Bunge Team, beat Kitui County Assembly 3-2 in post-match penalties after a barren draw in regulation time. The Bunge team included their Speaker Ken Lusaka (captain), senators Murkomen, Enoch Wambua (Kitui), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho), Stewart Mwazayo (Kilifi) and Mohammed Faki (Mombasa) among others. The majority leader was the main striker for the Bunge FC. Senators are in Kitui for the second edition of the Senate County sittings for a week. Plenary and committee sittings are taking place within the Kitui County Assembly. This is part of the 'Senate Mashinani' initiative.
