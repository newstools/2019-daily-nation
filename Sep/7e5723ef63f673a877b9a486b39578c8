LAUSANNE Former Uefa president Michel Platini told Swiss television channel RTS on Friday he "will be back" as his ban from football for ethics violations finishes on October 7. Platini, a former France captain, was stopped from partaking in all football-related activities in 2015 for receiving a Sh200 million ($2 million) payment from ex-Fifa chief Sepp Blatter, who was suspended for six years. "I will be back. I don't know where, I don't know how. I can't stay on the suspension, even if it's a suspension made by idiots," Platini said. "I was a victim of a form of a plot, yes, totally, between those at Fifa and those at the Swiss public ministry. There was an agreement between Fifa and them to sack me. I'm not going to say it was a plot by the Swiss state," the 64-year-old added.
