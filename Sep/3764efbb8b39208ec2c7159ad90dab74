It was a repeat of last year's race as Bernard Ng'eno and Delvine Meringor defended their Chemususu Dam Half Marathon titles in Eldama Ravine, Baringo County on Saturday. The annual half marathon, which entered its sixth edition on Saturday, seeks to promote conservation of the water catchment area and water supply in its environs. Ng'eno, who trains in Timboroa, Uasin Gishu, mastered the hilly course to finish first in 64:58 ahead of Leonard Lagat who clocked 65:15 while Samuel Kiplimo settled for third in 65:25. "The race was tough but I had good preparations which helped me retain my title. The hilly part in the course is what made me outshine the other athletes," said Ng'eno who is also the current Istanbul Half Marathon champion.   In the women's race, Meringor used her experience to win in 75:02 ahead of former Boston Marathon champion Sharon Cherop who clocked 75:33 while Lucy Cheruiyot emerged third in 75:40. Meringor, who trains in Kaptagat, said she was happy to win the race for the second year running. "Running with the best marathoners was not easy but I'm happy because I beat the competitive field," she said. Selected results 21km men 1. Bernard Ng'eno - 64:58 2. Leonard Lagat - 65:15 3.
