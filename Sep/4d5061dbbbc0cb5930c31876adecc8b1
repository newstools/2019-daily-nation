Three people died and 11 others were seriously injured after a wall collapsed on shanties near Likoni roundabout in Industrial Area. Two of the victims died on the spot, while the man was pronounced dead on arrival at Coptic Hospital. A team of rescuers from St John Ambulance, who responded to the 1pm incident, evacuated the injured to various hospitals, including Coptic and the Kenyatta National Hospital. “Investigation is ongoing to establish the possible cause of the collapse, but officials from the St John Ambulance suspect the wall caved in due to poor workmanship,” said Communications Manager Fred Majiwa. Last year, one person died and two others were seriously injured when a wall bordering a building under construction collapsed in Kahawa Wendani.
