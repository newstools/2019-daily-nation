Directorate of Criminal Investigations detectives on Monday recovered Sh1 million believed to be part of the Sh72 million stolen from Standard Chartered Bank in Nairobi West in a cowshed in Lurambi, Kakamega County. The detectives arrested a G4S employee Bernard Sewanga who had gone into hiding after the theft. The suspect, who was arrested in his newly rented house in Ruiru, Nairobi, led the detectives to the homestead of his father in law in Lurambi, where the money was found buried in a black bag in a cowshed. Thieves masquerading as police officers on September 9, 2019 stole Sh72 million from Standard Chartered Bank in Nairobi West. CASH Police told the Nation that part of the cash was stolen as G4S employees transported it in a van while the rest was withdrawn from an ATM. The G4S personnel had collected money from their headquarters on Witu Road and were taking it to StanChart’s Nairobi West branch. They left in two vehicles with men thought to be cash-in-transit officers escorting them. However, the officers turned out to be criminals on reaching Nairobi West and demanded part of the money. Later, they demanded for StanChart’s ATM passwords and withdrew more cash before they made away with 13 bags loaded with the Sh72 million.
