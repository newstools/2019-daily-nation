Four people were killed and 12 others injured in a road crash at Maragua River on the Kenol-Murang'a road, county commander Josephat Kinyua said Tuesday. The four were in a matatu which collided head-on with a lorry at the bridge. The police boss said the 12 people are receiving treatment at Murang'a Level Five Hospital. He said police have opened investigation to establish which of the two drivers was on the wrong. Mr Kinyua asked motorists to drive with caution in the area because many people have lost their lives on the said road. "Its unfortunate that we are losing lives along the stretch from Wajii, Blue gate, and Ithe Rui bridge mostly when drivers are negotiating corners, over speeding and overtaking, I urge motorists to drive with caution to avert more deaths," Mr Kinyua said. Last month, four people lost their lives in a road crash at Ithe Rui bridge after their vehicle lost direction and plunged into river.
