Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i on Sunday clashed with Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot at a funeral in Nyamira County over ouster claims. Senator Cheruiyot claimed that six months ago, the CS secretly met Deputy President William Ruto when he faced an impeachment motion. LYING While addressing the mourners at Kerumbe farm in Borabu constituency, Nyamira County Mr Cheruiyot claimed that he met Dr Matiang’i at Dr Ruto's office as he sought his support over an alleged impeachment motion against him. Dr Matiang’i told Mr Cheruiyot to stop lying to Kenyans for political mileage. “I have never been in that (DP’s) office, neither have I met him, let us stop lying in church. The lies people spread in public forums must stop,” said Dr Matiang'i. The Kericho senator alleged that ODM politicians led by Homa Bay Senator took an impeachment motion against the CS to the Senate. IMPEACHMENT “I was summoned by the DP who asked me what was going on (in the Senate). I later called all Jubilee lawmakers and that was the end of the planned impeachment,” claimed the Mr Cheruiyot. The two were among dozens of leaders Gusii who attended the burial of the late Stephen Mogeni, a local tycoon who had invested immensely in the tea sector. DP’s allies have been claiming that since Dr Matiang’i was elevated to spearhead government projects, the CS has been working to stop Dr Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni and his Kisii counterpart Prof Sam Ongeri told the CS to clarify the claims by their Kericho counterpart. They said it was important to clarify whether the CS met Dr Ruto. Led by Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama and his Kisii counterpart James Ongwae, Gusii leaders vowed to support the Dr Matiang’i.
