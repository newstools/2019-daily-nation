IN DOHA Former women's 800 metres world champion Eunice Sum on Monday timed 1 minute, 59.71 seconds to finish fifth in the final of the two-lap race at the 2019 World Athletics Championships. Sum, who was seeking to reclaim the title she last won in 2013 World Championships in Moscow, was Kenya’s only representative in the race held on Monday in Doha. Jackline Wambui, who had won the Kenyan trials ahead of Sum at Nyayo National Stadium on September 13, was left out of the team that travelled to Qatar. And on Monday, Sum said poor form cost her a place on the podium. She faded off after the first 400m and never found her way back into the race. “My first target here at the World Championships was to reach the final, which I did days ago. Being in the final has been the greatest achievement for me here. I am yet to regain the top form that saw me win races early in my career but I know I will come back stronger again." Sum said she will take a break from athletics and resume training later. Uganda’s Halimah Nakaayi won the race in 1:58.04, followed by America’s Raevyn Rogers who clocked 1:58.18. Sum congratulated Uganda’s Nakaayi on winning the title, saying the Ugandan ran a tactical race. “She ran a good race to win the world title but the winning time here (1:58.04) is not a quick time. In the coming period, I foresee faster times being posted in future championships." Nakaayi and her compatriot Winnie Nanyondo who came fourth in 1:59.18. America’s Ajee Wilson, who claimed bronze in the 2013 and 2017 editions of the World Championships, timed 1:58.84 to again finish third. To qualify for Monday’s final, former Africa and Commonwealth 800m champion Sum finished second in her semi-final heat in a time of 2 minutes, 00.10 seconds behind Nakaayi who timed 1:59.35 to qualify for the final. The 2017 world champion Caster Semenya and silver medallist from that competition, Francine Niyonsaba, did not compete in this year’s edition of the championship.
