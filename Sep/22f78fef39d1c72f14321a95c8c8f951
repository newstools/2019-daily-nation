Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu will be given back Sh15 million he posted as bail in his graft trial, after a Nairobi court allowed him to substitute the cash with a surety. In his application, which prosecutors did not oppose, Mr Waititu told the court that he was financially overwhelmed and needed to use the money to meet his daily financial obligations. Former Nairobi mayor John Ndirangu agreed to stand as his surety. On July 30, when Mr Waititu and 10 others were charged, he was granted Sh15 million cash bail, with an alternative of a Sh30 million bond and a surety, He sought to have the amount reviewed, but High Court Judge Ngenye Macharia turned down his request. Mr Waititu later paid the money after spending several days in custody. He went back to court seeking to get back the money and instead post bond and a surety. In an affidavit, Mr Ndirangu confirmed that he had not been coerced by Mr Waititu or anyone else to take up the responsibility. “Mr Waititu is well known to me. I have on a myriad of occasions visited his city and rural residence. I have extensive knowledge of his businesses and interests,” read the affidavit. Mr Waititu has been charged alongside his wife, Ms Susan Wangari Ndung’u, Mr Luka Mwangi, Mr Charles Chege, Ms Beth Wangechi, Mr Zacharia Njenga, Ms Joyce Ngina, Mr Simon Kabocho, Mr Anselem Gachukia and Mr Samuel Muigai.
