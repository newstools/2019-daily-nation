A prison warder on Sunday shot and killed his colleague at the Hola Prison in Tana River County. County Police Commander Fredrick Ochieng told Nation the incident took place at around 6am. The suspect was given a pistol to hand to the armoury when he accidentally shot his colleague identified as Mr Joseph Katama. "It appears the officer did not check the gun only to realise that it had an extra bullet," said Mr Ochieng. Mr Katana was pronounced dead on arrival at Malindi Sub-County Hospital. After the incident, the officer was disarmed and locked up pending disciplinary action. The county commander however noted that there was no conflict between the two officers.
