A former banker, who was found guilty of killing his girlfriend, was on Wednesday sentenced to 25 years in prison the High Court in Kitale. The court heard that Samson Kamau Njoroge murdered Alice Wangui Kamau and dumped her body in a borehole in his compound in May 2012 in Naisambu to evade her demands for child support. On the fateful night, Mr Kamau had attended a court case where the deceased wanted him to be compelled to take care of a son born in 2008 as a result of their secret relationship. The deceased went missing and sent distress calls to her family indicating that she had been kidnapped and was being raped repeatedly prompting a search by police. HEINOUS CRIME “She sent me a text on my phone saying she had been kidnapped and was being raped by the kidnapper,” Wangui’s aunt Eunice Wairimu told the court. Mr Kamau’s maid Veronica Njeri told the court that her employer did not spend the night at home on the fateful day. He arrived arrive early in the morning and sent her to the shop. “When I came back I found him washing clothes which I never saw him do during my two-year stay at the homestead. He later washed his car and left for work without his vehicle as was his norm,” said Ms Njeri. DENIAL In his defence, Mr Kamau denied involvement in the murder saying the reason he did not spend the night at his homestead on the fateful night was because he was very drunk and could not drive. “I went home in the morning and decided to wash my clothes since they were very muddy. My maid informed me that police officers were looking for me when I left for work,” said Mr Kamau. In his judgement, Justice Hillary Chemitei said circumstantial evidence tabled before court had linked Mr Kamau to the heinous act since Ms Wangui’s body was retrieved in his compound. “The police report indicated that the accused’s vehicle had blood stains. Who could gain courage to dump the body in his compound’s borehole without being noticed?” stated the judgment.
