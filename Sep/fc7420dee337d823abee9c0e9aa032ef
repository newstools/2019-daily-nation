A young man has died after he was allegedly battered by a group of men in Kiebogi village, Meru county. The group was allegedly hired by the victim’s parents to ‘instill discipline’ in the 31-year-old man. The man died after he was given a thorough beating by the men in the disciplining session gone awry. 'UNRULY BEHAVIOUR' The victim’s parents accused him drunkenness, use of abusive language and unruly behaviour. In the recent past, the man is said to have arrived home drunk and sung ‘dirty songs’ aimed at insulting his parents. Jane Patrick, the victim’s mother, admitted that her relationship with her with her son was not good over his behaviour but she denied that her husband and her had any role in his beating. She claimed her son arrived home at around 2:30am injured and asked for drinking water and that they found his lifeless body in the morning at around 6:30am. Angry residents gathered at the couple’s home threatening to flog them questioning why they took a long time before reporting the death of their son. Miruriri Chief Edward Gitonga said police are investigating the incident. “This is an adult and if he had committed any crime, he should have been reported to police. ‘People should use the right channels of handling cases and avoid taking the law into their hands,” he said.
