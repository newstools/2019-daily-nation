Three more suspects linked to violent crimes in Western region have been arrested. Samuel Mulimi Mbuhere, Wycliffe Achala Kinandi and Duncan Karana, who were arrested on Sunday, are being held at Mbale Police Station in Vihiga County. SUNDAY ARRESTS The arrests came following the ongoing operation in the county by detectives attached to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in Nairobi. DCI said the three, who were arrested in Vihiga following a forensic based analysis operation, are linked to a number of attacks and robberies using pangas and crude weapons. "They are directly linked to the violent crimes in Western Region," DCI said on its Twitter handle. CRIMINALS A similar operation in Vihiga conducted by DCI on Friday night led to the arrest of the most wanted suspects in killings that have rocked Matungu and Kilingili. Special Crimes Prevention Unit arrested 24-year-old Boniface Gubimiru alias Guga on Friday night after following leads from the DCI in Nairobi. The DCI in Nairobi, which coordinated the arrests, said this is part of operations to weed out hardcore criminals. The first suspect, Kelson Liyenga alias Kevin Lienga, was arrested by the DCI in Kawangware, Nairobi on Wednesday and transferred to Mbale for interrogation.
