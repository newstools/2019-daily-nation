Three people are recuperating at different hospitals in Meru following a botched murder-suicide incident. A teenage girl and her toddler were seriously injured after a man attacked them with a knife before he tried to take his own life on Thursday last week. The suspect, who is reported to be the girl’s boyfriend, stabbed her eleven times and cut their one-year-old baby on the face in an incident that left residents of Kautine village in Igembe North shaken. But nearly a week after the incident happened, police are yet to open investigation. Mr Joseph Kaumbuthu, the father of the 17-year-old girl, told Nation that police officers said they would visit the scene after the suspect had recuperated. Mr Kaumbuthu and his wife collected items from the scene of the attack including a suicide note, a pesticide, the weapon of attack and blooded clothes. Igembe North Police Commander Apollo Busolo confirmed that the incident was reported at Maua and Mutuati police stations but said the complainants never returned to give leads. According to the suicide note, the assailant wanted to eliminate mother and child before committing suicide. Mr Kaumbuthu said trouble started when he and his wife announced plans to take their daughter back to school. "He impregnated my daughter when she was in class eight but we forgave him. We allowed our daughter to take care of the child and plans were underway for her to go back to school. “When she told him that she was going back to school, he became violent," he said. Ms Beatrice Kaumbuthu, the girl’s mother, said the young couple had cohabited for some time. "They had a dispute after she informed the man that she is going back to school. “She came back home and informed us that he had threatened to stab her if she went back to school," she said. In the suicide note seen by the Nation, the man said the girl does not respect him, she hurls insults him and that she is always at her parents home.
