Recent reports of how police officers deliberately bungle investigations, leading to the collapse of criminal cases and allowing suspects to walk to freedom, are quite appalling. Police officers are at the centre of the criminal justice system and, together with the courts, the Director of Public Prosecution and prisons, is responsible for enforcement of the rule of law. Police officers are key in this criminal justice system wheel as success or failure at the investigation stage determines the outcome of a case in court, as happens on several occasions. Matters are made worse by defective prosecution rendering many criminal cases fatally flawed. Suspects in heinous crimes such as murder have been freed by courts for lack of evidence or wanting prosecution. Cases have been reported where police failed to do the most basic requirements, such as securing a crime scene or preserving evidence and exhibits in their possession. Itâ€™s instructive that courts determine cases on the basis of evidence tabled before them and litigation by the prosecution and defence teams. For the prosecution, successful presentation of these before a judge or magistrate goes a long way in determining success or otherwise of the cases they take to court. But what should be of even greater concern is when such failure is occasioned by police officers who bungle the cases, mostly for personal gain. A number of such officers are said to interfere with crucial evidence and exhibits or fail to get relevant witnesses to back up the cases, all with a view to making them fail. Little wonder that many criminal cases remain unresolved with no chances of the suspects ever being brought to book. The police must play their role effectively to advance the administration of justice. The State must also ensure that police officers deployed to investigative agencies are adequately trained.
