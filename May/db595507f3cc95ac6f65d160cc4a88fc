A police reservist was injured on Saturday night when suspected Al-Shabaab militants raided Hareri Hosle village in Mandera. Mandera East Deputy County Commissioner Lawrence Omondi said a food store was looted during the attack. Mr Omondi said the militants were probably on a mission to restock food for Ramadhan. He added that three cows and two goats were shot and killed during the attack. Hareri Hosle is next to the Kenya-Somalia border on the dangerous Mandera-Lafey-Elwak route, which closed by the Kenyan government in 2015. The route was closed after the militants killed 28 passengers in a hijacked bus that was heading to Nairobi.
