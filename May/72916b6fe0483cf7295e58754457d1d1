The government will not extend the registration period for Huduma Namba beyond Saturday, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has said. "There will be cost implications if we extend that period," CS Matiang'i said. However, for Kenyans outside the country, the National Integrated Information System (Niims) listing exercise has been extended to June 20. "We have deployed 154 KIEMs kit across our 54 missions around the world," he said. Mr Matiang'i said so far 31 million people have been registered. ICT CS Joe Mucheru said the Niims registration will enable the government to plan and offer services more efficiently.
