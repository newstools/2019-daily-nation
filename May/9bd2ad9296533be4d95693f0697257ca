Swedish prosecutors have reopened an investigation into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange. The inquiry has been revived at the request of the alleged victim's lawyer. Assange, who denies the charges, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. BAIL CONDITIONS The 47-year-old was evicted last month and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Swedish prosecutors originally decided to drop the rape investigation two years ago, saying they felt unable to take the case forward while Assange remained inside the Ecuadorean embassy. OPEN INQUIRY His release, and the decision to reopen the inquiry, is likely to raise the question of which extradition request should take precedence: that of Sweden or the US. The US wants to extradite Assange from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010. Australian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years.
