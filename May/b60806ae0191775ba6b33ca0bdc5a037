The Treasury has budgeted for a 3.9 percent pay rise for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, after it was cut in 2017. Treasury documents show that the combined annual pay — basic salary and allowances — of Mr Kenyatta and Dr Ruto will rise from the current Sh36.6 million to Sh38 million. The two top public executives saw their pay, together with other top officials,’ cut ahead of the general elections on August 8 to curb the ballooning wage bill. The cut saw the president’s salary drop to Sh1.44 million a month from Sh1.65 million, while his deputy took home Sh1.23 million from Sh1.4 million. At 3.9 percent, the presidency pay rise is unlikely to match the average inflation for this year, targeted at above five percent, up from 4.3 percent a year earlier. ESSENTIAL SERVICES The planned pay rise comes as the Treasury implements an austerity plan to free up cash for development and essential services such as security, health and education. The State has been grappling with missed tax collection, triggering a cash crunch that recently forced Treasury to review its budget. Treasury documents show the two executives will enjoy a combined allowances package of Sh15.2 million in the year starting July. Their combined pay for the new fiscal year will be Sh22.8 million, putting their combine package at Sh38 million. At Sh38 million, Mr Kenyatta’s and Dr Ruto’s combined pay is still 25.7 percent less their joint salary of Sh51.2 million for the year to June 2017 when State officers pay cut was announced.
