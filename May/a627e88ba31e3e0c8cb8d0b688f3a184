Two decomposing bodies of a male and female university students were on Monday found in a house near Kenya Methodist University, Meru County. Police suspect that the man killed the woman before committing suicide. The body of Ms Ann Kanario Kaura, 21, was found lying on the bed in a pool of blood with stab wounds on the thigh, while the man’s body, which had a deep cut on the left thigh, was found hanging from the roof. CRIMINOLOGY Ms Kaura, who hailed from Kangeta, was a student at KeMU, while the man who identified as Nyaga, studied Criminology at Chuka University. He hailed from Runyenjes. Mr Nelson Kinoti, the house caretaker, said he was alerted by neighbours who noticed foul smell emanating from the house before officers from Meru Police Station broke the door only to find the decomposing bodies. The police also found a blood-soaked knife on the floor that was also littered by broken utensils and clothes. “On Saturday, we didn’t suspect anything since it is normal for lights to be on and to have curtains drawn,” said Mr Kinoti. STRANGLED Meru County Police Commander Patrick Lumumba said they suspect the deaths happened at least three days ago since the bodies had started decomposing. He said the woman appeared to have been strangled. “It appears the two might have struggled. The door was locked from inside with a big padlock,” said Mr Lumumba. Ms Fridah Gaichugi, a green grocer who was among the first to view the bodies said she last saw Ms Kanario on Thursday as she bought groceries. “She was in a jovial mood and was looking forward to going on an industrial attachment. She was my good customer who never passed me without greeting me. I have lost a friend and a customer,” said Ms Gaichugi. Ms Damaris Gituma, a landlady in the area said many parents did not monitor their children. “We are saddened by this incident; such cases have become rampant,” said Ms Gituma. The bodies were taken to Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital.
