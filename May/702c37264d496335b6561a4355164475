Hi Brenda, Thank you for the good work. My problem is about my sister in law who does nothing in the house except to sleep and watch TV. I have talked to my husband about it but he keeps saying that she is still young and I wonder what that means. Still young for what? She has finished Form Four.  Hi, Thanks for reading! You need to give her work yourself if seeing her around bugs you that much and your husband isn't being helpful. Send her on errands and pay her for them, using your husband's money so that he is feeling a pinch as well. She should be contributing to the household â€“ not necessarily financially, but she has an able body and can do things around the house, like go on the errands you don't want to go on. Yes, she is still young, and yes it is fun to be young, but youth is fleeting, and bills must be paid. *** *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
