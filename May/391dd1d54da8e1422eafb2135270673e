Hi, Is shaving down there about hygiene or are there benefits of not doing it? My boyfriend insists on this but I find it so tiresome and waxing is so painful. Do you think I should go ahead and please him or I should just flatly refuse to give in to such painful demands?  Hi, I don't know about all that waxing stuff for just a boyfriend. How long have you been dating? I mean that feels like a wife move by the time you're sacrificing pubes at your own expense for a man you've been seeing for sijui 6 months. I think waxing is too painful to do for a man, but that's a personal preference. There are definite benefits, like if you are concerned about hygiene et al, but outside of those, I don't know that it's a requirement. A lot of women shave to feel good for themselves, and only themselves. If you liked it, it would be a different story. If you don't want to, don't. Or, ask him to shave so that his hygiene is 'taken care of' too, and you can feel the pain in solidarity as a couple... *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
