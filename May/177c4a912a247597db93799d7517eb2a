Human rights lawyer Gathii Irungu has pulled out of the race to become the Law Society of Kenya's male representative to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). Mr Gathii was one of four candidates set to battle it out for the coveted position in the elections on Thursday. Some 10,185 lawyers will troop to 28 stations across the country to elect their male representative, at a time when the Judiciary will be going through a transition as Chief Justice David Maraga and several judges are set to retire. Tom Ojienda, Macharia Njeru and Charles Ongoto are the other candidates in the contest. SHORT NOTICE Mr Gathii said on Wednesday that he had informed the LSK of his decision. In a statement at Kiambu Senior Members Club, he said, "It has come to pass that I shall have to withdraw from the race of the LSK's male representative at JSC." He added, "Due to the short notice that may mean I shall be in the ballot, I have requested the LSK to circulate this statement to all voters so that may not have wasted votes cast for me." POLITICAL FACTOR The lawyer said most of his supporters in the society had urged him to drop his bid for various reasons. He explained that coming from President Uhuru Kenyatta's backyard and having been involved in national and county politics, any decision he would make as a JSC member, if he won, would "be measured and interpretedÂ basically on political parameters". This, he said, would surely affect the JSC's operations and public perceptions, and result in accusations of being a partisan or adhering to the directions of the executive. Mr Gathii, who in the last term served as Kiambu County's Speaker, further noted the aspect of regional balance. He said he also considered that Professor Olive Mugenda, a member of the JSC, is also from the President's county.   Prof Ojienda to battle four other candidates in race to retain powerful seat.
