On Tuesday, Harambee Stars coach Sebastien Migne unveiled a provisional squad made up of 30 players who are poised to represent the country at the Africa Cup of Nations. A confident Migne said the squad will be trimmed to 26 players and will travel to France at the end of this month for a high-level three-week training camp ahead of the African football showpiece that will be held between June 21 and July 19 in Cairo, Egypt. The Frenchman’s selection was heavily criticised in some quarters for leaving out certain players, most notably Jesse Were of Zambia’s Zesco United and David Ochieng of AFC Leopards, and calling up the likes of Masoud Juma and Brian Bwire, a second choice goalkeeper at his club. However, it remains the prerogative of the coach to name his preferred team for the continental assignment. In any case, a coach, and a team for that matter, is ultimately judged on performance not who was or was not selected. Migne has set his sights on qualifying for the second round of the competition — a feat Kenya has never achieved in five previous outings. This dream can only be realised by the team’s technical bench putting in place proper preparations and determination, hard work and confidence among the players. It’s highly commendable that the government released funds in good time to help Football Kenya Federation secure a suitable training ground in Paris and arrange for build-up matches. It’s also laudable that the federation has put together an enticing reward scheme that will see players take home a minimum of Sh500,000 each for their sojourn to Egypt. The general feeling is that this time round, Harambee Stars has got the necessary personnel to hold its own against the rest of Africa’s best football players. Let us all support our team.
