Six suspects linked to killings that have rocked Matungu Sub-county in Kakamega over the last two months were arraigned on Thursday. They are Alex Wanzofu, Boniface Ochieng, Chrispinus Ataku, Isaac Watsula, Kevin Otieka and Fredrick Opiyo, who were arrested during a security operation after Standard One pupil Malik Wamukoya Murunga was killed last Sunday. Resident Magistrate William Lopokoiyit rejected their application for release on bond and ordered that they be detained at Kakamega Police Station for 14 days for police to finish the probe. MENTAL CHECKS In a written affidavit, investigating officer Samuel Asuke sought custodial orders saying police still had tasks to undertake. “We are yet to conduct mental assessments of the suspects and post mortems,” Mr Asuke said. In addition, the prosecution said more suspects will likely be arraigned this week. The case will be mentioned on June 5. SO FAR The arraignment of the six brings to eight the number of people taken to court so far over the bizarre murders. Two other suspects - Frederick Shitechi alias Abdallah Mucheva and Anerico Jimmy - were produced in court on Tuesday. The government sent officers of the General Service Unit (GSU) to the region last week following the killing of at least 20 people. Residents have complained that police officers are not doing enough to deal with the insecurity that has been linked to the 42 Brothers gang and its offshoot, which is known as 14 Brothers.
