Three people including a pastor have died in separate suspected cases of suicide in Trans Nzoia County. Police said that Bishop Emmanuel Nyongesa Simiyuâ€™s body was found in a maize store within his homestead in Kiungani in Lurambi on Sunday morning. He is suspected to have hanged himself. SUICIDE Trans Nzoia County Police Commander, Ayub Ali, told the Nation that they are yet to establish the reasons behind the suicide. Mr Protus Wanyama Wafula, 32, was found dead in Kiminini trading centre by his wife at 7am on Sunday. "The deceased sent his wife and their two-year-old child to the shop to buy milk. His wife returned only to find his body hanging from the roof of their rental house," said Mr Ali. Another person is also said to have committed suicide at Big tree village. The deceased, whose identify is yet to be identified, is said to have swallowed poison. SUICIDE NOTES Mr Ali noted that there were no suicide notes. He, however, said that the three incidents might have been triggered by emotional stress and family issues. "People should be closer to their families and always seek advice if there is a crisis," he advised. The three bodies were taken to Kiminini Cottage Mortuary.   It is not clear what drove the single mother to take the life of her daughter and attempt suicide.
