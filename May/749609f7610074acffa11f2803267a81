Politicians Cleophas Malala (Kakamega Senator), Rashid Echesa (former Sports Cabinet Secretary) and Libinus Oduor (Mayoni MCA) were on Friday questioned by police on the activities of criminal gangs in Matungu. Investigations have followed a rise in insecurity in the sub-county, where more than 10 people have died in one month. Mr Malala was arrested at Sovereign Hotel in Kisumu by officers who reportedly arrived in two vehicles. He tried to protest but was apprehended and taken to the Nyanza Regional Police Headquarters for questioning. Anti-riot police officers were deployed to the police station to maintain calm as a crowd started gathering. ECHESA MOVED Mr Echesa presented himself at the Western Regional Police Headquarters shortly before 6pm and was taken to an undisclosed location at about 7.25pm. A police source said he was moved to a police station outside Kakamega.   Mr Oduor, who had been summoned to record a statement on the issue, also presented himself to police. Mr Malala, Mr Echesa and Mr Oduor will spend the night in police custody. MATIANG'I ORDER Detectives said the politicians were being investigated on allegations of incitement and mobilising youths linked to the gangs. Kakamega County Police Commander Wilkister Vera said they were summoned in line with a directive by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i. Following the growing insecurity in Matungu, a section of leaders from Kakamega pointed the finger at the minister. The police boss said, "We summoned them following a directive by Matiang'i for all people linked to the incidents in Matungu to be investigated." Matungu MP will also be questioned on the killings. Outgoing Kakamega criminal investigations officer John Onyango said he was given six hours to present himself to the nearest police station.
