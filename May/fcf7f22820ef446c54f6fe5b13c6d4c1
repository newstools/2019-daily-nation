Dear Brenda, My husband found evidence of my cheating but has not said anything to date. He just kept quiet and I have been panicking because I donâ€™t know what he is planning. What do you think I should do to get rid of this fear? Should I just confess or let it die down on its own?  Hi, Yes. Confess. And please don't do it again. And then please examine exactly why you cheated, preferably with your husband, ok? The deeper problem is not that you're sleeping with someone else, but why. If he's planning something, you would rather know and confess it before he comes at it with you. He probably knows you know, and he is waiting for you to say so. So say so. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? Send your questions to lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com
