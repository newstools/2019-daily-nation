Ikonzo Secondary School in Butula, Busia County has been closed indefinitely after students protested the move by the management to bar them from attending term two games. The more than 350 students on Monday accused the Principal Giriama Busugwe of denying them the chance to participate in the games that kicked off at the weekend. Butula Deputy County Commissioner Winston Murunge said student leaders informed his office that Mr Busugwe had also enforced punitive rules that included a ban on old shoes and old uniforms. Mr Murunge revealed that upon receiving information on a looming students’ unrest, his office moved met with teachers and the learners in a bid to prevent the situation from spinning out of control.   GRIEVANCES “Among their grievances, the students said they were not happy with the action taken by the administration to bar them from participating in term two secondary school games even after preparing adequately for the event that kicked off on Saturday,” said Mr Murunge. He added that the students also complained that those with special needs have been denied requisite meals and further accused Mr Busugwe of mistreating them alongside teachers. “To facilitate thorough investigations that will help us get to the root cause of this matter, we have told the students to go home indefinitely to avert destruction of school property,” he added. The principal escaped from the school after learning that the officers were headed there. “We thank the students for maintaining high levels of discipline as they protested to air their grievances. No one was injured or school property destroyed during the incident,” Mr Murunge said.
