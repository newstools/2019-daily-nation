Joseph Irungu aka Jowie, who is charged with the murder of Nairobi businesswoman Monica Kimani, on Tuesday renewed his bail application before justice James Wakiaga. Mr Irungu told the High Court judge that his circumstances had changed and that his family was willing to deposit a security. His lawyer David Ayuo said a relative had offered to house him and ensure that he attends court. Mr Ayuo also noted that this client cannot interfere with witnesses as they are under protection by the State. He added that Mr Irungu cannot travel since police have his passport. OPPOSITION State prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki opposed the application, saying the accused had not presented any new grounds. Ms Mwaniki also pointed out that Mr Irungu sent a threatening message to Ms Kimani's brother a day before she was killed. She added that the accused is a threat to witnesses despite their protection and because he is a firearm handler, so his application should be rejected until they all testify. Ms Mwaniki further told the court that Mr Irungu has no fixed aboard and if released, will jump bail and flee from the country, never to be traced. Justice Wakiaga directed Mr Irungu to appear before Justice Jessie Lesiit on May 29 for directions on the hearing. He will decide on the fresh bail plea on June 18. PAST RULING Mr Irungu is charged alongside Citizen Television journalist Jacqueline Maribe, who was freed in October 2018. At that time, justice Wakiaga denied Mr Irungu's request for bail, saying he was a flight risk, had access to weapons and could intimidate witnesses. He released Ms Maribe on Sh1 million cash bail or a Sh2 million bond with a surety of the same amount, saying the prosecution failed to table compelling reasons to deny her freedom. The murder case will be heard on June 18.
