Ferry services at the busy Likoni channel were Saturday disrupted after a petrol truck got stuck on the mainland ramp. The truck almost plunged into the Indian Ocean after it failed to climb up the ramp on the Likoni side. The truck blocked the ramp where ferries dock for vehicles and commuters to get in and out of the vessels. Efforts by Kenya Ferry Service (KFS) workers to use MV Nyayo to help remove the truck were futile and passengers had to wait. The incident caused traffic snarl-ups on both sides of the channel.   Some motorists forced their way into MV Kwale after they waited for more than one hour to cross. At the time of publishing, the petrol truck had not be moved.
