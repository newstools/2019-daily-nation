Shock and grief gripped residents of Lamjuu village in Belgut, Kericho County on Monday, after a woman's body and those of her three children were discovered in her house. The woman is suspected to have poisoned her children aged five, three and six months before committing suicide. Curious residents suspected that something was amiss after noticing that the woman, whose main door remained locked, failed to wake up. LIFELESS BODIES They then peeped through the window only to see four lifeless bodies lying on the bed. Belgut Sub-County Police Commander Philip Okello, who confirmed the incident, said the woman’s landlord and tenants reported the incident at Sosiot Police Station. Assisted by the neighbours, the police who broke the main door, found a bottle of Steladon pesticide near the bed. “There was a pungent smell of pesticide in the room where we found the four bodies, there was white foam on the woman’s mouth. A pesticide known as Steladon was recovered on near the bed,” said Mr Okello. The woman’s brother Mr Ezekiel Omondi said she had a quarrel with her husband a week ago. The bodies were moved to Sigowet Sub-County Hospital mortuary.
