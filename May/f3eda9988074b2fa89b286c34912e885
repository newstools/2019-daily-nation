Police in Nyandarua have arrested a 25-year-old man suspected of defiling and impregnated a 16-year-old pupil in Wanjura village, Mirangine Sub-County. The suspect, who is a boda boda rider, is said to have threatened to kill the Class Eight pupil if she revealed what he had done. He is reported to have ambushed the minor while she was on her way home from a shop, forced her into a farm a short distance from her house and defiled her. “We have the suspect and he will be taken to court for plea taking as we request for more time to investigate the matter. It is a complicated case that requires proper investigations since the incident happened months ago,” said Mirangine Sub-County Deputy County Commissioner Omar Ali. MEDICAL REPORT He said the minor disclosed the incident after a medical report confirmed that she was pregnant. About three months ago, the girl’s mother suspected that she was pregnant but the pupil insisted she was not. On Monday, the mother requested her elder daughter to accompany her sister to a private clinic at Tumaini market for a test where the pregnancy was confirmed. “She revealed the incident after the medical report confirmed she was pregnant. The suspect is well known to us, he sat his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam about five years ago,” said the mother. TRAUMATISED She said she had also noticed some change in her daughter’s behaviour, who appeared traumatised and mentally disturbed for the last couple of months and this affected her performance in school. "The suspect's relatives are nagging me for an out-of-court settlement. They want to pay for damages but no amount of money can restore my daughter's dignity. I appeal to the police to conclusively investigate the matter. I want justice for my daughter, she is five months pregnant,” said the mother. She said her daughter is a bright pupil willing to continue with her education and that her school has allowed her to continue attending classes.
