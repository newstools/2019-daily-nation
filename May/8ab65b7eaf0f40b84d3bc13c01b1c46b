A Form One student at Kisumu Girls High School mysteriously died at the institution Friday morning after attending morning preps. According to Kisumu County Commander Benson Maweu, the girl left class at 6.30am and went to the dormitory. Her colleagues, however, became concerned when the girl extended her stay in the dormitory and went to check on her, only to find her weak and unable to stand up. “They notified the school matron who organised for her to be taken to the nearby Kisumu County Referral Hospital where she was pronounced dead,” said the police boss. A preliminary police report shows that the girl had been sick for the past one week and was being treated at the school's dispensary. Some parents who spoke to Nation claimed the school’s officials are very strict and that they are always reluctant to release students to seek medical attention when they report that they are feeling unwell. Officials at the school declined to comment on the matter. The body was moved to the mortuary of the hospital where it is awaiting a post-mortem examination.
