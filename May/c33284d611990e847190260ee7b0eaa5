A woman has stabbed to death a suspected intruder at her shop in Ngangarithi Estate in Nyeri Town in the wee hours of Thursday morning. Police say two robbers broke into the retail shop at 3am armed with crude weapons and stole goods which they hid in a nearby bush. The woman’s husband said he received a phone call from a neighbour that their kiosk was being broken into. They rushed to shop and accosted the thugs who reportedly took off in different directions. The husband and neighbours chased after one of the burglars, leaving behind the woman at the kiosk. The second thug is alleged to have been hiding near the shop and came back and attempted to rape the woman. KITCHEN KNIFE During the scuffle, the woman is said to have reached for a kitchen knife and stabbed the robber in the neck. He ran off but collapsed and died a few metres from the kiosk. “It is true there was such an incident this morning. We are still processing the information but we will release the details later,” Nyeri Central deputy sub-county police commander Bernard Amugune told the Nation. Police said they were able to recover the stolen items as they pursue the other robber. The body of the deceased was taken to the Nyeri County Referral Hospital mortuary.
