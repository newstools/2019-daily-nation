Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga has challenged Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa to quit the Orange Democratic Movement. Ms Wanga accused the Malindi legislator of disrespecting ODM, the party that sponsored her to the National Assembly. "If she (Ms Jumwa) is woman enough, she should resign (as Malindi MP) and prove that she can retain the seat,” Ms Wanga said on Monday. UNDER FIRE Ms Jumwa has been under fire from ODM party over her support for Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. The MP, has, however, stood her ground and vowed not to move out of ODM. Ms Wanga accused the Malindi legislator of disrespecting party leadership and flouting party rules. Speaking in Magunga market in Homa Bay County on Monday, Ms Wanga told Ms Jumwa to join Jubilee Party. “If she (Ms Jumwa) walks with jubilee politicians, why can’t she join them,” said Ms Wanga, adding that she will not sit back and watch some politicians attack the ODM party and its leadership. Ms Wanga was accompanied by MPs Mishi Mboko (Likoni), Eve Obara (Kabondo Kasipul) and Woman Reps Ruweida Obbo (Lamu), Fatima Gedi (Wajir) and Christine Ombaka (Siaya). INSTABILITY Ms Mboko dismissed claims that ODM leader Raila Odinga was causing division in Jubilee party. "Some politicians in Jubilee have been accusing Mr Odinga of trying to create instability in their party, he just wanted Kenya to be peaceful,” Ms Mboko said. Ms Gedi urged all Kenyan leaders to support handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Odinga for the sake of development. She asked the two leaders to conduct a nationwide tour to initiate development projects. "Homa Bay County has numerous challenges including poor roads and lack of water. So do other counties. I appeal to the President and ODM leader to tour different counties to understand the challenges they face," the MP said.   A resident says the action is an affront to democracy.
