Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick as Arsenal reached the Europa League final on Thursday with a 4-2 win over Valencia and a 7-3 triumph on aggregate. Alexandre Lacazette was also on target as the Gunners became the third English Premier League side to reach a European final this week following Liverpool and Tottenham's epic Champions League semi-final fightbacks. Arsenal, whose last appearance in a continental final was their 2006 Champions League loss to Barcelona, will face either fellow Londoners Chelsea or Germany's Eintracht Frankfurt in the final in Baku on May 29.
