Storms are poised to topple champions Equity Bank from top of the Kenya Basketball Federation women’s Premier League table as they conclude their first leg assignments with two matches at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium this weekend. On Saturday, high-riding coach Abel Nson’s Storms, who have won three straight matches, will meet new-look, inexperienced USIU-A Flames, under coach Cliffe Owuor from 11.30am. Storms, who are also seeking to improve on their third place finish last year, will host struggling Kakamega-based Western Delight at the same time. On Sunday, Flames, with only one win from four matches this season, will again face hungry opponents in newly promoted Africa Nazarene University, who will be looking to win their first match of the season. ANU, winners of last year’s women’s Division One league title, were last weekend clobbered 42-69 by Strathmore University before Zetech rocked them 58-48. Storms are placed second on the 12-team table with 14 points with five wins and four losses. They are favourites to harvest maximum four points which will see them end the first leg on top of the league standings on 18 points. Reigning champions Equity Bank, have also garnered maximum 14 points from seven outings. Equity, the only unbeaten team in top women’s competition, have no engagement this weekend.
