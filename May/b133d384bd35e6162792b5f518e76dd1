One person has been injured after a fuel tanker overturned near Marua junction along the Nyeri-Nanyuki highway. The turn boy suffered minor injuries in the Thursday morning incident and was rushed to the Nyeri County Referral Hospital for treatment. The driver of the truck is said to have taken off as soon as the truck landed on a ditch near Sagana River. “We received a distress call early today that there was an accident. By the time we arrived, the driver had taken off but the other occupant was injured and taken for treatment,” Nyeri Central Deputy Police boss Bernard Amugune said. SAFETY MEASURES The Nyeri County fire department dispatched firefighters to the scene as a cautionary measure as rescue teams worked to clear the scene safely. “The scene is still volatile and we are doing all we can to maintain safe flow of traffic and clear it safely,” the police boss said. Police said that the dawn incident was self-involving but were still trying to establish exactly what transpired at the time the tanker rolled. They will also be investigating if the crash was intentional, amid suspicion that the tanker’s crew could have siphoned fuel from the truck.
