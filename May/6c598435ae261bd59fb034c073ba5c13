Three people, including a woman, who had been charged with carjacking have been sentenced to death by a Kerugoya court. Josphat Njoroge, Hilder Njeri and Michaelson Mutinda were found guilty of violently robing a taxi driver, Mr Ibrahim Mwangi, of Sh3,300 and the court ordered that they face the hangman's noose. They were also convicted of attempting to rob Mr Mwangi of his vehicle valued at Sh900,000 while armed with knives and other dangerous weapons. They committed the offence on October 5, 2016 in Kabendoso village in Kirinyaga County. Senior Resident Magistrate Erick Wambo said that evidence adduced in court proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the offence was committed by the accused. WATERTIGHT EVIDENCE "The offence took place in broad daylight and the evidence by the prosecution witnesses is watertight," said the magistrate. Mr Mwangi was in Kerugoya town when he was approached by three people posing as passengers. They told him that they wanted to be taken to Kabendoso to see a farm they wanted to buy. After agreeing on the fare, the passengers got into the car but on reaching Kabendeso they turned out to be criminals and attacked Mr Mwangi. SCREAMED They frisked but as they attempted to rob him of the car, he screamed for help attracting scores of villagers who rescued him and arrested the attackers. They were then frog marched to the local police station where they were questioned and later charged with the capital offences. In mitigation, the convicts said they were the sole bread winners for their children and that the court should be lenient on them. But the magistrate said his hands were tied as the law provides for a death sentence for such an offence.
