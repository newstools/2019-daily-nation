One of her teachers who sought anonymity said the student sat her Kenya Certificate of Primary Education four years ago but could not proceed to secondary school after giving birth. “She had two other children, this could have been her third child,” the teacher said. COMPLICATIONS The girl is said to is said to have developed complications while in school before she was rushed to Sori Lake Side Hospital after her condition deteriorated on Wednesday evening. “The doctors discovered that she had lost a lot of blood while trying to procure an abortion,” said the teacher. The three-months-old foetus was removed and was later buried at the girl's home.
