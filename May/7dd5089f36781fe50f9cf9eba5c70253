Ms Esther Mwaniki has been selected as a 2019 fellow for the Obama Foundation Fellowship. She is among 20 fellows selected from 10 countries around the world, and one of only three Africans. The other two Africans are Mr Ayman Sabae Shamseya from Egypt and Ms Dedo Baranshamaje from Malawi. Ms Mwaniki, 36, is the founder of Lapid Leaders Africa, a leadership programme that equips new graduates and final-year university students with skills to help them cope beyond university. These skills include self-awareness, creativity and innovative thinking and building a Pan-African mindset driven by values. “It’s our responsibility as the older generation to raise the younger generation and selflessly empower the next leaders,” Ms Mwaniki says of the programme. LEADERSHIP The other fellows selected are doing work around mental health, education, financial empowerment for communities, social entrepreneurship, climate justice and healthcare delivery. “I applied for the fellowship because Lapid had grown to a point where we are ready to scale up. I wanted to work under, and around, people who would take the programme across the continent. Youth leadership is a global agenda.” So, what does she envision the programme will look like two years after the fellowship? “That’s a good question,” Ms Mwankiki says as she pauses to think. “I’d like us to have reached more young professionals, even the ones who are already working. I’d also like the programme to be online. I’d also like us to build the systems and structures that will accommodate our scaling up.” Esther worked with PwC Kenya, a global professional services firm, from August 2004, after graduating Kenyatta University with a bachelor’s degree in accounting, to 2011 when she quit to form Lapid.
