Uganda's opposition leader Kizza Besigye once grabbed the headlines as he led mass protests and frequently got arrested. But over the last two years musician-turned-MP Bobi Wine has garnered more attention as the voice of the opposition to the long rule of President Yoweri Museveni. He has led a series of protests, said he was tortured by the security forces and is currently facing treason charges. So does Mr Besigye feel eclipsed by the newcomer? "Eclipsed from what?" he asked, responding to the question on the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. "It's rather a misplaced concept. The struggle that is going on is not a struggle for leadership. "The contestation that is going on is for liberation, so that the country can be truly under the control of citizens. "There is interaction between all the fighters for freedom to regain that freedom."
