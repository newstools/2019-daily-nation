Vet Lab Sports Club’s Ebill Omollo took a narrow one shot lead at the close of round one in the Eastern Flour Mills-sponsored Railway Invitation at the par 72 Kenya Railway Golf Club course on Saturday. The handicap two Omollo, who started the day with a bogey at the par five-first hole, managed to birdie the eighth hole to finish the first nine on level par. He almost ruined his day after a double bogey at the beginning of the back nine. He followed that with a bogey at the 13th but birdied the 14th, 16th and the par five 18th to level the course and take a one-shot lead from two times Coast Open champion Mathew Wahome of Nyali who carded one over par 73. Wahome now back after his studies in Cape Town South Africa, dropped a shot at the second, picked up a double at the sixth. PULL ONE BACK He however managed to pull one back at the seventh, picked up two more birdies at the 10th and 14th against a bogey at the 13th, to put himself in a challenging position for Sunday’s final round of the Kenya Amateur Golf Championship (KAGC) series event. Home player and tournament favourite Samuel Njoroge and Kiambu’s Mike Ngene tied for third place on two over par 74 apiece, with Royal Nairobi’s Kevin Juma finishing the day on fifth place on three over par 75. Njoroge, the Kenya Amateur Stroke Play and KAGC defending champion, started with bogey at the first hole, but quickly recovered.
