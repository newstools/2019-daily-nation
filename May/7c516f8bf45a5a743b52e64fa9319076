Kennedy Owino was the hero as Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) put up a spirited fight to sink AFC Leopards 1-0 in a midweek SportPesa Premier League match at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos. Leopards, who are set to face their bitter rivals Gor Mahia in the Mashemeji derby on Sunday, will rue the missed opportunities in the encounter. Leopards coach Andre Casa Mbungo rested a host of his star players namely Paul Were, top-scorer Wyvonne Isuza, David 'Cheche' Ochieng and Rwandan Soter Kayumba. "We were unlucky and tired today," said Rwandan Mbungo. "He (Isuza) was not feeling okay since yesterday and then we have been playing three matches every week for the past three months, I needed to shuffle things a bit and bring in some fresh legs and we almost got a point here." In other results, Zoo Kericho battled from a goal down to beat visiting Western Stima 2-1 at the Kericho Green Stadium, while high-flying Sony Sugar edged hapless Kariobangi Sharks 2-0. And in Machakos, the bankers scored completely against the run of play as Kennedy Owino created space for himself in the box and slotted the ball past the advancing Leopards goalkeeper to score the only goal of this match in the 34th minute. Leopards attempted to retaliate and curved out chances via centre back Christopher Oruchum, who could only watch his first-half header off a Eugene Mukangula header come off the crossbar. And then, Vincent Oburu was also fed through on goal by Aziz Okaka but his shot failed to trouble KCB goalkeeper Joseph Okoth.
