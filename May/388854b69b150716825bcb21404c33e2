Telecommunications firm Safaricom says it has restored its mobile money transfer service, M-Pesa, following an outage reported Thursday evening. In a statement via its twitter page, the company also apologised for the inconveniences caused. The firm blamed the malfunction on hitches affecting its database. “We have restored all M-Pesa services following an outage that occurred 1805hrs,” the telcos said. Last year, a similar technical fault was reported where users were unable to transact due to technical hitches affecting the database.
