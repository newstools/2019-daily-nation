Despite being a serious security concern, it emerged that the junior officers who had visited the school did not brief their seniors about the incident. PESTICIDE However, Mathira East Sub County Police Commander James Baraza, who learnt of the incident from the media said: “I can now confirm that the incident actually happened at around 10am on Monday,” he said. Mr Baraza said detectives who visited the school, found an empty pesticide bottle, which was later handed over to public health officials, in the tank that serves over 360 pupils.
