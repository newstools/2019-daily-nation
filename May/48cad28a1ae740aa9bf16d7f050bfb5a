Property worth millions of shillings was on Monday morning destroyed when fire gutted a dormitory at Tengecha Boys Secondary School in Bureti, Kericho County. The inferno, whose cause is yet to be established, broke out at around 6am Monday as the students were in class. INVESTIGATIONS “No injuries were reported in the incident, investigations have commenced,” said Bureti sub-county Criminal Investigations Officer Stephen Tanki. He said the students salvaged only a few items from the dormitory which housed 172 students. Last year, fire also destroyed a classroom in the institution. Members of the public, students and teachers, however, managed to put out the fire before it could spread to adjacent dormitories. LEARNING DISRUPTED Firefighters from the Kericho County arrived at the institution when the inferno had been put off. Learning was disrupted at the institution. Parents, who sought to know the fate of their children, jammed the institution in the morning.
