Patrick Okullo on Saturday scored from the spot to propel relegation battlers Vihiga United to a 2-1 victory over Chemelil Sugar in a SportPesa Premier League match at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega County. Vihiga won a penalty after Chris Masinza was brought down in the box by Chemelil’s James Omino in the 87th minute which prompted referee Agneta Itubo to point to the spot. Itubo’s decision was heavily disputed by the visiting side. Earlier, Chemelil had snatched the opener via Vincent Mahiga in the 35th minute following a rightwing cross from Nicholas Akoko in the tension-filled match which was full of fouls due to numerous fouls committed in the encounter. Vihiga, who had a poor show in their five previous matches in the league, managed to equalise through Victor Ademba in the 66th minute, before Okullo sealed the miller’s fate in the 87th minute. Led by coach Francis Baraza, Chemelil players protested the penalty on the strength that assistant referee Doreen Kendi had already raised the flag to signify that Masinza was off side when the infringement happened. “We shall not entertain such kind of officiating. The referee has an assistant to guide her in case of anything. It is sad that such a situation came up when the league is on the home stretch,” he complained. Vihiga tactician Sammy Okoth said they deserved the victory. “In any competition there is always a winner and a loser. We won fairly and my focus is on our next match in the league,” he said. There are six matches on the cards on Sunday with three high profile clashes set to entertain fans. Leaders Gor Mahia play Western Stima in Kisumu, Mathare United play AFC Leopards at Bukhungu while Tusker host Sofapaka in Machakos County.
