The government has released Sh14.5 billion to primary and secondary schools across the country as part of free education funds. Education Principal Secretary Bellio Kipsang said Sh10.8 billion was been released to secondary schools while primary schools received Sh3.65 billion. Dr Kipsang said the funds will enable principals and headteachers to serve learners effectively. “The funds have started to reflect in schools bank accounts,” the PS said on Thursday. Schools opened for second term last week and are expected to close on August 2. The funds, he said was transmitted through the National Education Management Information System (Nemis) unlike in the past when the Ministry of Education relied on the information that principals of secondary schools provided. The government pays Sh22, 244 annually for every secondary school student and Sh1, 420 for each pupil in primary school. Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha said Nemis will enable provision of quality, reliable and timely education statistics to enrich the government’s planning processes. “The unique identification issued to schools, learners and all members of staff in our institutions of learning will improve the management of resources in the education sector and allow all efforts to be directed at achieving quality education for sustainable development. "Through this system, education sector players will get to know the status of education in regard to access, quality, equity, relevance, efficiency as well as institutional development,” said the CS.
