A US pastor and his wife shot and killed a suspected burglar at their home in Houston, Texas. The pastor, the Rev. Jeff Powers, 52, and his wife, Julie Powers, 54, told police that they were awakened by noises coming from the backyard of their west Houston home around 11.30pm Saturday, and both retrieved firearms, ABC reported. The couple opened fire on the man and he was struck by several bullets.  "A preliminary investigation revealed the residents were asleep in their bed when they were awakened by a loud noise. While investigating the cause of the noise, they noticed their backyard gate was opened and saw a male (suspect) in their back yard," police said in a statement released on Monday. "The suspect then forced his way and gained entry into the residence. The residents, in fear for their lives, discharged their firearms several times, striking the suspect," the statement read. Both guns used in the shooting have been recovered, officials said. No charges were immediately filed against the couple. In a statement to ABC, the United Methodist Church said Powers and his wife are "mourning the loss of life and cooperating fully with authorities."
