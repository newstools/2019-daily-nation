More than 20 teams from Nyamira County on Tuesday received a major boost after gaming sports company SportPesa through the Kit For Africa initiative gifted them uniforms at Sironga playing ground. According to the company’s assistant marketing manager, Franklin Mwenda the kits were donated by fans of English Premier League sides Everton and Southampton alongside those of Championship club Hull City which the company sponsors. “We are aware that most teams in the grass roots lack training kits something that hinders development of young and fresh talents hence why we requested EPL teams to collect their old kits and assist teams in Africa” he said. The region lacks teams in the main leagues in Kenya with its teams taking part in the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) division 2 league. “We are very thankful to the company, we have been having problems during training sessions with most players forced to train barefooted something that exposes them to injuries” said Mr John Momayi, a beneficiary. SportPesa and the said teams work together to collect kits donated by fans, players and members of the public before distributing them throughout Africa to less privileged individuals. “Money is not a solution to everything because at times you can sponsor a team and the funds are mismanaged so it’s good to give material support” Mwenda added. The Kit For Africa initiative was launched three years ago and has been a huge success with just over 75,000 kits collected and passed on to football-loving communities all over the African continent. The Kits For Africa campaign is part of SportPesa’s pledge to transform lives and is in effect in Kenya and Tanzania with the company saying it will soon be introduced in South Africa.
