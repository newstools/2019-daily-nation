Hundreds of Mombasa residents were on Wednesday in a rush to register for Huduma Namba before the May 18 deadline. Earlier this week, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said the government will not extend the registration period for Huduma Namba beyond Saturday Some parents made their children skip school so that they could get registered. Senior citizens, pregnant women and parents with babies were not spared the pain of waiting in the long queues. Mr Charles Owino, a resident, said he spent a second day on the queue at the Majengo chief’s camp and he is yet to get registered. Some residents claimed they had been on the line since 3am. “I came here at 3am and some people spent the night here. I don’t understand why it should be so difficult to get the number,” Mr Jack Maingi said.
