Police in Kisii have recovered five Friesian cows stolen in Nyandarua County and arrested two suspects. Eleven dairy cows were stolen from Mr David Kuria's farm in Mirangine constituency, Nyandarua County, on Wednesday night. The owner reported the matter to police the next day. According to Kisii County Commissioner Godfrey Kigochi, his counterpart in Nyandarua informed him on Friday morning that the cows had been spotted in the region. "We decided to deploy police officers in all markets across the county following reports that the cows had been seen in one of the markets," said the police boss. Police recovered five cows, and one died on the way. Three had already been sold and police could not account for the other two. "We are still searching for the two cows. The suspects, who are in custody, are assisting us with information," said Mr Kigochi. The recovered cows were found at Daraja Mbili, the main market in the region. Mr Robinson Kuria, the son of the owner of the cows, said they had made arrangements to ferry the five cows back home. "We suspect that some people in Nyandarua are colluding with others in Kisii to steal," he said. The farm had 20 cows. The vehicle used to ferry the animals was being held at a Kisii police station.
