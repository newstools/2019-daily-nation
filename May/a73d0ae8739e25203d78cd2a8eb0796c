Three suspects were on Friday arraigned over the murder of Murang’a prison warder Pauline Wangari. The trio was arrested in Kericho on Thursday while they were on their way to Kisumu, police said. The court detained the suspects, Joseph Ochieng, Rodgers Namkuro and Mary Amollo until May 31 after police asked for more time to complete investigation. SEARCH WARRANT Ms Phoebe Okomo, the investigating officer, also requested for a warrant to search the suspects houses for a television set, a mobile phone and a laptop that were stolen from the house of the victim. A police officer, who is involved in the investigation, told Nation that the main suspect, Mr Ochieng, fled to Kericho after committing the crime. He got a lift from Mr Namkuro and Ms Amollo to Kisumu before police arrested them. The police officer said Mr Ochieng met Ms Wangari on Facebook and had visited her for the first time in Murang’a the day she was found murdered. “After engaging in sex, they had a quarrel and the victim was furious with the man. She revealed to him that she was a police officer and the suspect became violent. “He strangled and stabbed her three times then placed a knife in her hands to make it look like she had committed suicide,” the police source said. Meanwhile, another suspect, who was arrested on Wednesday over the murder, was released on police bond after officers withdrew the charge against him. While applying for the withdrawal of the case, the investigating officer Abdalla Ali told the court that they had arrested the main suspects believed to be behind the murder and that there was no reason to continue holding Mr Peterson Njiru. Mr Ali said Mr Njiru will be required to be appearing at the county’s Directorate of Criminal Investigation headquarters if need arises. Nation established that Mr Njiru was arrested because he was the known boyfriend of the prison warder.
