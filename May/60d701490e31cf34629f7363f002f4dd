Families of two university students whose decomposing bodies were found inside a house near Kenya Methodist University, Meru town, want their deaths probed. The parents of Obedi Nyaga and Ann Kanario Kaura, 21, were Tuesday still trying to come to terms with the shocking incident. They said they were not aware that their children were in a relationship and want police to probe the matter and provide answers. The body of the woman was found lying on the bed in a pool of blood with a wound in the thigh, while the man was found hanging from a sisal rope and had a deep cut in the left thigh. Police said they suspected that the man killed the woman and then committed suicide. Mr Richard Kathuku, Mr Nyagaâ€™s uncle, said they were yet to travel from their Makengi home in Embu county to view the body. At Kieya village, Meru county, Mr Isaac Kaura and his wife Jerusha Nkirote were still in shock after viewing the body of their daughter at Meru Referral and Teaching Hospital. They called for a probe into the deaths. Addressing the press at their home, they said they lost communication with their daughter on Friday.   Police suspect that the man might have killed the woman before committing suicide.
