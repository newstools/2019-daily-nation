Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has suspended any setting up of new public universities. Speaking in Nairobi during a forum on University Education, Prof Magoha said the current universities are too many and not sustainable. "I have received requests to increase the number of universities... you must apply the breaks," said Prof Magoha. He said there is no reason to have six universities in the same place teaching the same thing. "No money will come from government to support you," Prof Magoha told the university administrators. CONSOLIDATION The CS has directed universities to ensure good staffing norms and suggested merger of the institutions. "Rationalisation of academic programmes should be done. If possible the existing universities can be consolidated," he said. He directed the Commission for University Education to prepare a report regarding the status of universities, qualification of academic and support staff, supervision of students, lecturer to students ratio, and facilities and equipment for teaching. He said the report should be submitted to the Ministry by July 31 this year.   Kenyan universities are acclaimed for proficiency in research and innovation.
