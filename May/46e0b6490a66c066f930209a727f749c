AMSTERDAM Jan Vertonghen will be back for Tottenham Hotspur when they face Ajax in the return leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday, coach Mauricio Pochettino confirmed. The Belgian defender came off in the first half of last week's 1-0 defeat in the first leg after suffering a nasty head knock, and missed Tottenham's trip to Bournemouth at the weekend as a result. "He didn't suffer anything more than the cut on his nose. A lot of players keep playing in the same situation. It wasn't a big issue," insisted Pochettino at a press conference in Amsterdam on Tuesday evening. "I think he's ready to play." The Spurs coach also suggested that reports Vertonghen would wear a face mask were wide of the mark. In addition, Erik Lamela has been back in training and could feature, while Son Heung-min is available after missing the first leg due to suspension and then being sent off as Tottenham lost 1-0 at Bournemouth. Harry Kane, Harry Winks and Serge Aurier are all out, though, as Spurs look to reach the final of the Champions League for the first time.   Donny van de Beek's early goal beat an injury-hit Tottenham 1-0.
