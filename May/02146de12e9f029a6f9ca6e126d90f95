I was a bit ratchet earlier in my life, mainly in campus, and I got into wrong crowds and relationships. I ended up having multiple relationships and three abortions, that was like six years ago; before I decided to practice secondary abstinence. I also got saved and I have tried to live a good Christian life since then. I met my boyfriend in church two years ago and recently he has been talking about marriage and a future together. He is saved. I want to be open about my past so there are no bad secrets between us that can pop up in future, but I am afraid this will ruin everything for me. I need help.  Hi, You can be open about your past now, because it's better than you doing it later. The thing is, the longer you keep it, the longer it eats at you. The quicker you tell him, the quicker you can deal with whatever the repercussions are. On the plus side, there's a chance he'll appreciate your honesty. On the negative side, there's a chance that he'll hold that against you and you'll break up. If he does break up with you, then he wasn't worth you in the first place. We all have a past, and it doesn't have to be a part of your future. Neither does he. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? Send your questions to lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com
