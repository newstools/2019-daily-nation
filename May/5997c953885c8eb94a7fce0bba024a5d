Police in Nakuru have arrested two people who attempted to free a suspect from custody at the Nakuru Law Courts. Nakuru East Sub-County Police Commander Hellena Wairimu said the suspects, who are being detained at the Nakuru Central Police Station, ambushed a prison officer, who was escorting a suspect from the courtroom to the cells in a bid to free him. The suspect had been found guilty of being in possession of bhang worth Sh200. But the sentencing was deferred to May 30 after the prosecution requested for more time to get exhibits of the case. While the suspect was being taken out of the court room, a mob confronted the security officer, pushed him into a ditch and tried to run away with the suspect. “The officer blew his whistle to alert his colleagues who rushed to his rescue,” Ms Wairimu said. Chief Inspector of Nakuru GK Prisons Kamau Maina said the prison department will record a formal report on the incident that interfered with court proceedings. The police boss said the two suspects will be arraigned May 24 to face charges of aiding a suspect to escape custody. The bhang suspect will face a fresh charge of escaping custody.
