Safaricom staff were on Sunday forced to leave Uhuru Park, Nairobi, in a huff after a group of people caused commotion during an event to award Kochokocho participants. The group had gathered at the park after receiving text messages on Saturday from the company, requiring them to attend the event. The said message read: “Come to Uhuru park tomorrow (Sunday) and get your free Safaricom gift, free customer care, lots of fun and games for kids. Thank you for participating in Kochokocho.” CUSTOMERS However, the customers, who were expecting ‘expensive’ prizes, trouped to the park only to be disappointed by the ‘small’ gifts which were being distributed by the company's staff. As a result, they grew agitated and forced the staff leave after security officers got overwhelmed. Some of the participants latermarched up to the Nation Centre in protest. “I was happy on receiving the message because I did not win anything during the promotion, but I was shocked to see carrier bags, pens and hats. For me, the message lost meaning,” said Mr Joseph Nyandika, who said he had travelled from Kamulu. GIFTS According to Mr Mark Mwangi from Limuru, the company had not indicated the kind of gifts it was giving people. He said the process should have been more transparent. On her part, Ms Lucy Odhiambo said she travelled from Ruai with her three children expecting to be gifted. But, just like others, she was disappointed for not receiving anything. But an official from the company said they never were forced to abandon the event stating that they left after the stipulated time was over. SH63.4 BILLION The official said the message was tailored for residents from west of Nairobi only. “The message was not meant for everybody but only residents from west of Nairobi. We were there the whole day and people received gifts. So whoever said he/she came from Kisumu was lying,” he said. This came up only some hours after Safaricom announced huge net profit of 63.4 billion.
