Detectives from the anti-graft agency on Wednesday arrested acting Nairobi County Secretary Ms Pauline Kahiga over allegations of hiding documents in graft investigations at City Hall. There was drama at City Hall as Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officers arrived at Ms Kahiga's office but were blocked from accessing the office. The fracas lasted for about an hour before the acting county secretary, who adoubles up as Devolution and Public Service Management executive, was finally arrested and driven to the EACC offices for grilling. Journalists who had arrived at City Hall were kicked out by the security guards. EACC spokesperson Yasin Amaro confirmed Ms Kahiga's arrest.
