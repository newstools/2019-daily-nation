Kenya’s road to the 2019 World Athletics Championships begins today, with Athletics Kenya (AK) picking the marathon teams for the competition to be held from September 28 to October 6, in Doha, Qatar. However, the athletes who will represent the country in the track and field events will be selected during the national trials planned for August 15 to 17, at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, Nairobi. Already, a number of athletes have made their case for selection to the marathon teams and the selectors must ensure that only the very best go to Doha. The Kenyan men will be seeking to retain the title Geoffrey Kirui won in the 2017 championships in London, while the women will be out to reclaim the crown Edna Kiplagat won in 2013 in Moscow. In the track and field events, the three-leg AK Track and Field Meetings held last weekend in Nyeri will culminate in the institutional and regional championships, to be followed by the national trials to select teams for the World Championships. The 2019 Diamond League Series started in the Qatari capital on Friday, and Kenyan athletes are expected to use it to gauge their performances ahead of the World Championships. World champions Elijah Manang’oi (1,500 metres) and Hellen Obiri (5,000m) gave an early indication of what they are capable of doing by effortlessly winning their races. However, they must not be complacent as tougher challenges lie ahead for them. The busy athletics season will also see Kenya hold trials from June 20 to 22 at Kasarani to choose athletes to take part in the Africa Games from August 23 to September 3, in Morocco. AK selectors must rely on merit when picking Team Kenya athletes for these championships.
