A father and his two children have taken to court the battle over the ownership of a Sh2 billion luxurious hotel in Bamburi, Mombasa, with claims of illegal transfer of shares. Mr Wildfred Gurnther Herbert Osser, a German national, has sued his two children, Ronny Patric Herbert and Jeanie Notalie Boehlig, over a “fraudulent” transfer of his shares in Hanos (K) Ltd and for forcibly evicting him from his apartments. ILLEGAL SHARE TRANSFER Hanos (K) Ltd owns and operates the popular Papillion Garden Bar Villa on the Mombasa-Malindi road and adjacent to Jomo Kenyatta Public Beach. The resort sits on more than two acres. In the lawsuit, Mr Osser accuses the children of illegally transferring his shares from the company and removing him from the list of directors when he left the country between 1998 and 2009. Mr Osser says he has never signed any document to transfer his shares to anyone. The case will be heard on July 23.
