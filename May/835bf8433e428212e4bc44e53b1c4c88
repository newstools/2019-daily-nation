Former Kakamega Senator Bobi Khalwale on Friday announced his defection from Ford-Kenya to Jubilee barely a week after his party summoned him to face a disciplinary committee over misconduct. The Ford-Kenya deputy party leader made the announcement at his Malinya home in Kakamega County where he was hosting Deputy President William Ruto. He cited threats by the Ford-Kenya leadership to kick him out from the party as his reason of joining the ruling party. "I will not be ashamed to find space for the Luhya people in the next government" he said. Politicians who attended the Malinya meeting include Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, MPs Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), Caleb Ositanyi (Soi), Justus Murunga (Matungu), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Khatib Mwashetani (Msambweni) andÂ  Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula). Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa also attended the meeting.
