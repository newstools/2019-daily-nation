A student was killed after fire swept through a dormitory at Njia Boys Secondary School in Igembe, Meru County. The fire broke out on Wednesday during evening prep time, officials said. But the death of the student was noticed Thursday as the students searched through the debris. They stumbled upon what looked like remains of a human body. A head count was done and one student was found missing. An official at the school, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press, said the cause of the fire is yet to be established. “First responders did not notice the body because it was burnt badly and only small parts of the body remained,” she said.
