A section of Mt Kenya Forest has been destroyed in yet another bush fire as the water tower continues to suffer damage for the fourth consecutive month this year. The fire broke on the moorland section of Marania Forest on the eastern side of the mountain in a case of suspected arson. Kenya Forest Service Eastern Regional boss Beatrice Mbula said that by Sunday morning the fire had been contained but rangers would remain on the mountain to monitor the situation. “There were small pockets of fire earlier this morning in the moorland. KWS and KFS teams and other stakeholders responded and managed to put it out,” Ms Mbula said. The cause of the fire and extent of the damage are still subject to review but officials believe it could have been deliberately lit. CONCERNS The latest fire has raised concerns among foresters and environmentalists as it occurred during the rainy season, something which is not common. KFS officials now says that following the fire, the fire danger alert will remain in place after concerns that there could be more fires. The officials were betting on the rains to help reduce the risk of fires. But with the poor rains that have been received so far, they say a big part of the forest could still burn. “Protecting the mountain is quite technical but we are doing all we can. The fire danger alert will remain in place until we are sure the fires have been stopped completely,” KFS Central Highlands Head of Conservation David Muigai said.
