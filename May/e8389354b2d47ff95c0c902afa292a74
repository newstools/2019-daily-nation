The suspect was arraigned on Monday at the Eldoret Law Courts but police sought for more time to conclude investigation into the matter.

The club manager, Mr Jonathan Munyaka, told the Nation that the management of the club was working closely with the police to establish what transpired on the material day. “It is true that the incident happened at our club and we are working with the authorities to unravel the truth. The victim is a common reveller at our club and we have nothing to hide,” said Mr Munyaka. Mr Murei Kimutai, the spokesperson of Mr Kibet's family, said that a post-mortem will not be conducted on the body of the victim to establish hia death since a CT scan had already been conducted.
