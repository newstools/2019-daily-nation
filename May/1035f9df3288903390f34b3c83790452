Migori County Assembly members on Wednesday passed an impeachment motion against Deputy Speaker George Omamba. The motion to oust the deputy speaker was tabled in the House by Kaler Ward MCA Thomas Akungo who accused the North Kanyamkago Ward representative of professional misconduct. MCAs claimed the deputy speaker was arrogant, insensitive to the staff and uses his office to seek undue favours from the executive and the assembly. Speaking to the press after the session, Mr Akungo said the former deputy speaker had grossly abused his office and failed to discharge his mandate as an elected member of the House. “Today we have had a motion that passes a vote of no confidence against the deputy speaker. We have voted overwhelmingly to oust him,” said Mr Akungo. He said the MCAs had followed all the necessary laws in the impeachment motion. Of the 56 MCAs in the assembly, 46 voted to support the impeachment motion while two declined to vote.
