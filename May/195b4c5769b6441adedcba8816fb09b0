Mount Kenya region risks being locked out of government in 2022, should the division among the region's political leaders persist, Gatundu MP Moses Kuria has warned. Mr Kuria said MPs who have joined the Tanga Tanga and Kieweleke political camps are doing the region a disservice. Speaking at Kageeri Catholic Church in Embu County on Sunday, Mr Kuria advised the leaders to unite for the benefit of the region. DIVIDED “Instead of uniting to bargain for political power in the 2022, our MPs are divided," said Mr Kuria who warned that unless the lawmakers remained united, the region would not have a fair representation in next government. “Our leaders should be thinking on how the region can benefit from the next government in terms of development," he added. He told the leaders to fight to be part of the next government. "It doesn't matter who will become the next president, what matters to me is the region's representation in the country’s top leadership," he stated. DEVELOPMENT Mr Kuria who was accompanied by MPs Muriuki Njagagua (Mbeere North) and Gitonga Muruga (Tharaka) and Senator Njeru Ndwiga, vowed not join any of the two political groupings. Mr Ndwiga said that the region’s development was crucial. Mr Njagagua hit out the government over alleged harassment of political leaders in Kakamega and other parts of the country. He said that elected leaders should be treated with respect. "The government should stop arresting leaders over mere allegations," he said in reference to the arrest of Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and Matungu MP Justus Murunga.
