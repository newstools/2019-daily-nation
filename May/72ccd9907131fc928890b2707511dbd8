There was drama Saturday in Buruburu estate when Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, accompanied by a number of county staff, stormed Glad Tidings Crusade Ministry, where a demolition was taking place. Mr Sonko and his team confronted the demolition squad, which claimed it had a court order to do the job. The governor would hear none of it, maintaining that the demolition was illegal. His team, which included county government askaris, proceeded to rough up and “arrest” some of the members of the demolition squad. “I will personally pursue the matter in court to ensure justice is done for the genuine owners of the property,” Mr Sonko said in a statement on his Facebook page. Police denied knowledge of any arrests as no one had been taken to any stations in the area and that they had not been notified about the demolition. “We were not aware of the demolitions until later in the day when officers were sent there,” said Kamukunji Sub-County Police Commander Adamson Bungei.
