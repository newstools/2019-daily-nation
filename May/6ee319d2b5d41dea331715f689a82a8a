Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge won't be seeking to win a first World marathon title in Doha this year. Kipchoge, the world marathon world record holder, has opted to defend his Berlin Marathon title in a race planned for September 29 in the Germany capital. The World Championships will run from September 28 to October 6 in the Qatari capital. It's at last year's Berlin Marathon where Kipchoge obliterated the world record with a new time of 2 hours 01 minutes and 39 seconds. Kipchoge, who is fresh from running the second fastest time in marathon history when winning in London in 2:02:37 last Sunday, disclosed on his social media accounts that he will be back in Berlin to defend his title. Kipchoge was tweeting from the Germany capital. “In German capital again. First time after World Record. Emotions and energy coming back. I shall go back there to defend my title. For now, I am happy to be back in Berlin for a visit."("Berlin forever" - remember?) Anyway plans for Autumn should be known in a week,” said Kipchoge, the 2003 World 5000m champion who has won 11 out of 12 marathon races. He will be making his fifth appearance in Berlin where he made his World Marathon Majors debut in 2013 to finish second, the only time he ever lost in Marathon. He settled second in 2:04:05 as compatriot Wilson Kipsang broke the marathon World record in 2:03:23. Kenya's Dennis Kimetto would improve the record at the same course with a new time of 2:02:57 in 2014. Then Kipchoge shattered it last year.   The 25-year-old wins in 2 hours, 18 minutes and 20 seconds.
