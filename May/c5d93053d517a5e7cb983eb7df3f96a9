Police in Nakuru on Monday impounded 135 bales of bhang with a street value of Sh4 million. Confirming the incident, Nakuru Police County Commander Stephen Matu said officers intercepted a petrol tanker that was transporting the narcotic drug from Wajir to an unknown destination. “We got a tip-off that a truck was ferrying bhang from Wajir,” said Mr Matu. He said that the Special Crime Prevention Unit tracked down the suspects using a mobile service provider's tracking system.   The truck driver Hassan Ali was arrested in Mwariki, Nakuru County. “We found the tanker stashed with bales of bhang,” said Mr Matu who added that they are pursuing other suspects who escaped. Two months ago, police officers in Nakuru seized 2,159 stones of bhang with a street value of Sh3 million. Rongai Deputy County Commissioner Julius Kavita said the drug was found in an abandoned vehicle in Salgaa on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway by officers on patrol.
