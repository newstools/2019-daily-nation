NYON, SWITZERLAND Uefa has drafted a controversial plan to introduce promotion and relegation to the Champions League, favouring bigger clubs, at a meeting at its Swiss headquarters in Nyon, sources told AFP on Wednesday. There would be four groups of eight teams from 2024 if the proposal is put into action, significantly increasing the amount of European matches. But Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin played down the plan, saying: "What is important to remember, is that, despite a lot of talk in the media, no decisions have been made. At the moment we have only ideas and opinions."   The event brought together 244 clubs from 38 countries.
