Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha has said that he has no power reinstate the 160 teachers who were interdicted by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) a week ago. DISCIPLINE Prof Magoha said this on Monday even as he affirmed his commitment to meet the Kenya National Union (Knut) of Teachers on Tuesday to discuss the issues surrounding the implementation of the new curriculum. He said it is the employers mandate to instil discipline on their employees. “The interdiction can only be lifted but the TSC and not the Ministry of Education,” he said during the launch of the TSC 2019-2023 strategic plan. A week ago, the commission  suspended the teachers for disrupting the Competency Based Curriculum training conducted in April. The letters indicated that the teachers were suspended for neglecting their duties by refusing to attend the curriculum training, inciting colleagues who were attending the training and insubordination of curriculum support officers. DISRUPTED TRAINING The teachers were accused of disrupting the training held in April where 91,320 teachers participated. The exercise involved 68,490 teachers in grades one to grade four and 22,830 head teachers. Some of the teachers have been given 21 days to file their responses with the TSC. Others have been given seven days to show cause why they should not be sacked. They are also required to provide evidence to support their case. Prof Magoha has called for a stakeholders meeting with the Knut, which has opposed the implementation of the new curriculum, to iron out their differences. SUSPENSION On Sunday, Knut Secretary-General Wilson Sossion threatened to issue a strike notice if the TSC does not withdraw the suspension letters of the 160 teachers. Mr Sossion has also demanded suspension of the implementation of the curriculum. He, however, said he was prepared to engage the Ministry of Education over the implementation of the new curriculum.
