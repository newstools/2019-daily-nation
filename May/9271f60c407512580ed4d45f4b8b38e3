High riding Tangit Sparks have taken the women’s basketball Premier League by storm and are set to take over the league leadership if they win their upcoming two matches at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi this weekend. Formerly Masaku Sparks, the team that was staring at relegation in the face last season before landing a sponsor, thus surviving the chop by a whisker are currently placed second in the 13 teams league table with seven points, one less than leaders Equity Bank. With two matches on the cards against Zetech University Titans on Saturday and African Nazarene on Sunday, Tangit Sparks are on the brink of dislodging defending champions Equity Bank from the top since the bankers will play only one match this weekend — against Western Delight in Kakamega. Tangit Sparks Team Manager Mitchel Otinda says the journey has been tough but he is confident they have come of age and are ready to dine with the queens of Kenyan basketball. “We formed this team five years ago as Eastern Queens and got entry to play in the top league as Eastern region representatives then changed the name to Masaku Sparks and now here we are with Tangit who undertook to support the team late last year,” said Otinda, a former USIU and Kenyan international.
