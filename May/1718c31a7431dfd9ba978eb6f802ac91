Que sera sera. With a late withdrawal of Gold Pot, As Paragon seemed like a natural pursuant of the Nairac Gold Trophy Sprint, until Go Pro tried earnestly topple the dynamo, only half-a-length adrift. Flash Harry deliberated not to enrich the sport's cultural fabric this time round. He conducted his own orchestra alone, uncharacteristically a distance further back. No hassle for Rising Dragon in the Marafa Maiden as she cast aside the more seasoned, Glascote Rose. Paul Kiarie must have been off-colour as he was deputised on two instances by James Muhindi and Daniel Tanui. Trainer, Stewart McCann, rubbed elbows with a double, while Patsy Sercombe feasted on a conventional treble. NGONG RESULTS 1.15 pm - First Race - Shanga Maiden (1,200m) 1.
