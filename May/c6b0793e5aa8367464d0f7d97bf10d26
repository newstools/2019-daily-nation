Four Chinese men arrested in Lodwar on Tuesday for allegedly assaulting a Kenya National Highways Authority's road inspector have been set free after the complainant allegedly dropped the charges. NEGOTIATIONS The four, Wang Kai, Lui Jiang, Zhao Liangbin and Li Shaoqing, are employees of China Railway No. 5 Engineering Group Co. Ltd which is upgrading of Loichangamatak - Lodwar section on the A1 road. They were released on Tuesday night, hours after their arrest, following lengthy negotiations that involved their employer. A source privy to the talks said Engineer Rodgers Imasia decided not to pursue the matter further after the meeting with the suspects and China Railway. The four had been accused of physically assaulting the KeNHA official last week after he criticised their work at KM 54. ARRESTED According to a police report, the suspects, who were arrested on Tuesday, went into hiding after committing the offence. The assault led to protest by local workers at the Chinese company's construction site at Kanam Kemer in Turkana Central sub county on Monday morning. The workers claimed that Chinese employees were enjoying special privileges.
