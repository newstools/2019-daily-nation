Two people arrested for repackaging expired rice in Nairobi’s Kariobangi area will remain in police custody for 10 days. In a ruling on Thursday, Senior Resident Magistrate Paul Mayova directed that John Mbugua Kariuki and Jeremiah Kuria Kimani be remanded at Parklands Police Station. Mr Kairuki and Mr Kimani were found repackaging several bags of assorted expired rice into the bags of foreign brands with extended expiry dates. In addition, it is suspected that they supplied other food stuff that was unfit for human consumption to other parts of the country. THE PROBE Mr Mayova issued the directive after the Directorate of Criminal Investigations sought to have the two detained for the said period. The DCI said in its application that it needed to finalise the investigation and that it would likely extend to the port of Mombasa, where importation documents would be authenticated. The court further heard that investigations were being carried out in collaboration with the public health team, Kenya Bureau of Standards, Kenya Revenue Authority and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution. “The agencies require time to sample and analyse the rice,” said investigating officer Loyara Ewoi. The case will be mentioned on May 27.
