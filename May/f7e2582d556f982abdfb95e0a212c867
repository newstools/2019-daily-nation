Red-hot Rwandan striker Jacques Tuyisenge is set to exit Gor Mahia at the end of this season if K'Ogalo accept a Sh15 million bid tabled by Angolan side Petro Atletico. Petro Atletico, who played K’Ogalo in the Caf Confederation Cup group stage this season, have tabled a jaw breaking deal worth Sh15 million in a bid to lure Tuyisenge to the Angolan capital. In addition to this amount, Petro have also committed to paying 20 percent of proceeds from any future sales of the player. With Gor playing Posta Rangers on Saturday before completing the season on Wednesday in Kisumu against Mathare United, the club management has unanimously chosen to remain quiet on the goings on regarding Tuyisenge’s transfer until the end of the campaign. A source close to the club however told Nation Sport on Saturday morning that: “They (Petrro) have tabled a very good offer, but the executive committee is still divided. Some members feel that the player is worth more than the Sh15 million and others feel that it is time to let the player go since such a deal may not come by again." “Last evening’s meeting was inconclusive and we shall have another one on Monday to deliberate further on this issue.” Tuyisenge joined the club in 2016 from Rwandan side Police FC, and has endeared himself to the club’s fans with his performances and demeanour on and off the pitch. He has scored seven goals so far this season, which makes him the third best scorer at K’Ogalo behind Nicholas Kipkirui and Samuel Onyango. Besides Petro, the soft spoken Rwandan captain has also been linked with Tanzanian giants Simba and Congolese heavyweights AS Vita. He is however bound to Gor by a contract which runs up to January next year. Tuyisenge is currently in Machakos where Gor are scheduled to face Posta Rangers in their penultimate league match after which they will be presented with the trophy.
