Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi on Sunday said he regretted that Amani National Congress (ANC) party had turned down his request for dialogue. Mr Osotsi said the party said that the window for dialogue had been closed. The legislator told journalists in Vihiga that ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, through his lawyer, had written to him informing him that the party would not hold any more dialogue with him. WRANGLES The MP had written to Mr Mudavadi on May 6, asking for a one-on-one talk with him over the wrangles facing the party. The wrangles have led the party into asking the Registrar of Political Parties to remove Mr Osotsi from the party register. "He (Mudavadi) has written to me through his lawyer saying that the window for dialogue is closed," said the legislator. In his letter to Mr Mudavadi on May 6, Mr Osotsi had indicated his willingness to end wrangling in the party. He said in the letter: "Pursuant to the relevant provisions of ANC party constitution, I hereby request face to face meeting with you." IMPASSE "This request is the initial step to resolve the current impasse in the party." The MP said it was regrettable that his party was unwilling to embrace dialogue even after he showed interest. He said his team of lawyers was preparing for any eventuality, considering the ANC party has requested the Registrar of Political parties to strike his name off the party register. "My team (of lawyers) is ready. I had given a genuine commitment to the party. Chest thumping will not help," said Mr Osotsi. He added: "The court ordered that issues under contention be taken back to internal dispute resolution. From my end, I have indicated the process." "I am asking (Mr) Mudavadi to take this opportunity to demonstrate leadership. It is only him and I who know the secrets of this party. I am ready for dialogue and compromise," he said.
