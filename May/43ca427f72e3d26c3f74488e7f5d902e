Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova: "The verdict against Semenya is dreadfully unfair to her and wrong in principle. She has done nothing wrong and it is awful that she will now have to take drugs to be able to compete. General rules should not be made from exceptional cases." Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe: "I understand how hard a decision this was for Cas and respect them for ruling that women's sport needs rules to protect it." Megha Mohan, BBC Gender and Identity reporter: "The spectrum of identity stretches far beyond the binary, say human rights activists, so shouldn't Semenya's physical abilities be celebrated the same way as Usain Bolt's height and Michael Phelps's wingspan are? Either way this verdict does not signal the end of the debate." Timeline:   But Cas said it had "serious concerns as to the future practical application" of the new rules.
