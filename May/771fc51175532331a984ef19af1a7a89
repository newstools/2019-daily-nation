A Nairobi court has found that Sirisia Member of Parliament John Waluke and businesswoman Grace Wakhungu have a case to answer for obtaining millions of money for maize they allegedly did not supply. The two directors and their firm Erad Suppliers and General Contractors Ltd are accused of receiving money from the National Cereals and Produce Board after falsifying documents. Senior Principal Magistrate Elizabeth Juma ruled that the two and the company have a case to answer. The court heard that they allegedly presented a false invoice of Sh115,072,725 on February 24, 2009 as evidence in the arbitration dispute between the company and NCPB. They purported that the invoice was to support the cost of storage of 40,000 metric tonnes of white maize, which was allegedly incurred by Chelsea Freight. It is alleged that they further obtained Sh297,386,505 on March 19, 2013 for loss of profit and interest allegedly incurred by Chelsea Freight. In June 2013, they got Sh13,364,671 purporting to be the cost of storage for the maize. On the last count, they are accused of obtaining Sh2,413,113. Senior Principal Magistrate Elizabeth Juma directed that the trial begins on June 13.
