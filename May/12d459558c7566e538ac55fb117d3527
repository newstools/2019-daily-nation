A court in Maralal, Samburu County has allowed the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to detain for seven days an Administration Police (AP) officer who is accused of killing his boss at Maralal Police Station. This will allow the detectives to complete investigations into the incident before presenting the suspect in court to take plea. While making an application before Senior Resident Magistrate Abraham Gachie on Monday evening, investigating officer Steven Ndonga said that remanding the suspect in police custody for one week would also enable DCI to conduct a mental examination on him and conclude a post-mortem examination on the body of the dead officer. EXHIBITS DCI also seeks to acquire key exhibits before presenting the suspect in court on Monday next week. The AP officer, Patrick Marwa, attached to the Samburu Central Sub-County AP line in Maralal was arrested and detained at Maralal Police Station after he allegedly shot Senior Sgt Duncan Cheruiyot, killing him on the spot, in an incident that shocked the country last Saturday. It is alleged that the junior officer claimed his boss transferred him from the place where he has been working at a Chinese construction company site along the Nyahururu-Samburu road before shooting him. A G3 rifle, 10 rounds of ammunition and eight spent cartridges were recovered from the scene of crime.   Motive of the killing was not immediately established.
