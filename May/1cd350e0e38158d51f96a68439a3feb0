Four men were charged on Thursday with stealing more than Sh2.8 million from Barclays Bank's automated teller machine (ATM) at Kenya Cinema Plaza in Nairobi. John Otieno Makambongo, George Gachungui Njoroge, Daniel Orero Okindo and Fredrick Herman Otiya faced Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Kenneth Cheruiyot. They were charged with two offences - conspiring to commit a felony and stealing. “The accused persons conspired with others not before court to commit the crimes between April 1 and April 16,” the court was told. The suspects were arrested on April 26 and locked up at Muthaiga Police Station. They denied the charges and were released on Sh500,000 cash bail each ahead of the hearing on June 5. FOUR CASES A string of robberies during the Easter weekend left Barclays Bank short of at least Sh11 million after four ATMs were broken into. It is alleged that the robberies were planned as the machines were either unmanned, tampered with or had the CCTV cameras obstructed. In the first case, Sh 6,290,000 was stolen at Mutindwa, Nairobi, at an unspecified time. The machine had been loaded with Sh 7 million but two days later, Sh 6,290,000 was found missing. The second incident took place at Mater Hospital where Sh1 million was stolen while the third, on the same day, saw the loss of Sh4.3 million at the Kenyatta National Hospital ATM.   Robbed ATMs were either unmanned or had malfunctioning surveillance cameras.
