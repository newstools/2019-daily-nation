Kenyan fishermen, who were arrested by Ugandan officers on accusations of overfishing in Lake Victoria earlier this week, have been set free. The 24 fishermen were released on Thursday evening after paying fine. They were charged in a Ugandan court early Thursday and were fined Sh30,000 per boat. A total of eight boats were seized by Ugandan officials. Homa Bay County Beach Management Unit Network chairperson Edward Oremo confirmed that the owners of seven boats had paid their fines by Friday morning. He said his team is intervening to ensure the owners of the eighth boat raise the fine. The fishermen were arrested by security personnel from Uganda who were patrolling the lake, Homa Bay County Commissioner Irungu Macharia said. The officers from Hama Island in Uganda also confiscated fishing gears, including nets and eight boats, belonging to the fishermen. Kenyan officials said those arrested are from Suba North and Suba South in Homa Bay County.
