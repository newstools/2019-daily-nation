Eleven parents of Shin Hyun Primary School in Tharaka-Nithi County spent Tuesday night at Makutano Police Post after they were arrested for planning to storm the school to eject the headteacher, accusing him of misappropriating funds. Speaking to the Nation, Tharaka North OCPD Benson Makumbi said the 11 will be charged in a Marimanti court with unlawful assembly. “The 11 will be charged with unlawful assembly because we arrested them outside the school while planning to storm in to eject the headteacher,” said Mr Makumbi. He added that the parents had been meeting to plan on how to throw out the headteacher, Mr James Kamau. ACCUSATIONS Speaking to journalists, the parents accused Mr Kamau of misappropriating the school’s funds and contributing to the deterioration of its performance. They also said Mr Kamau is using the police to intimidate them. Some of the parents have already withdrawn their children from the school, vowing to take them back once the headteacher is transferred. But Mr Kamau blamed his predicament on his recently transferred deputy, whom he accused of plotting his ouster with a section of the parents.
