Three suspects have been arrested over the brutal murder of the chief of Kamaindi location in Tharaka-Nithi County. Irate residents cornered 52-year-old Japhet Mayau Mukengu, slashed him with pangas and then set him on fire in connection to a prolonged dispute over the murder of a man in 2018. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) reported the arrests via Twitter on Wednesday, without identifying the suspects. "Further investigations are ongoing to bring all those involved to book," the DCI said. Tharaka-Nithi County Commissioner Beverly Opwora earlier said police were investigating the incident. WHAT HAPPENED Sources claimed the residents were angered after the chief’s brother, Gikware Mukengu, detained goats belonging to resident Gitonga Kibuibe, who went missing in December 2018. The goats had reportedly trespassed into Mr Mukengu’s land. Mr Kibuibe's remains were found in the nearby River Thuci three weeks ago. It was said that he went to bathe in the river on December 12, 2018 but never returned home. Villager alleged that he was killed by the chief’s brother. Locals said that after the chief’s brother declined to release the goats, villagers sought the intervention of Igambang’ombe deputy county commissioner, who reportedly sent the chief to handle the matter. Before the chief arrived, hundreds of residents stormed Mr Mukengu’s home baying for his blood but he managed to escape. Not aware of what had happened to his brother, the chief went to resolve the dispute but the mob attacked him.   Villagers said to have been angered by harassment from chief's relatives.
