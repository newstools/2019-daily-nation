The Sh213 million corruption case against former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero will proceed following a ruling by the High Court on Tuesday. The court dismissed Dr Kidero's application to delay the entire matter pending determination of his appeal against the charges. Dr Kidero and eight others are accused of conspiring to commit fraud which led to the loss of Sh213,327,300 at the county government between January 16, 2014 and January 25, 2016. Through lawyer James Orengo (Siaya Senator), the former governor had argued that the charges were not specific and that they were meant to embarrass him. He also said the prosecution did not indicate how they conspired, acted corruptly or fraudulently and occasioned the loss of that amount of public funds. TEMPORARY RELIEF On Monday, a magistrate temporarily put off the trial pending the outcome of the appeal at the High Court. The accused were informed of Dr Kidero's challenge when they appeared before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. Ahead of the ruling on whether to terminate the charges, Mr Ogoti directed the suspects to appear before him on Tuesday for a status update. Dr Kidero is charged alongside former county employees Lilian Ndegwa (County secretary), Jimmy Mutuku Kiamba (Chief Finance Officer), Gregory Mwakanongo (Finance and Planning minister), Stephen Ogago Osiro (head of accounting), Luke Mugo (acting CFO) and Maurice Ochieng Okere (acting head of Treasury). John Githua and Grace Njeri of Lodwar Wholesalers and Ngurumani Traders Limited are accused of fraudulently receiving payments from the county.
