Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) Noordin Haji has defended President Uhuru Kenyatta and Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga against against claims of involvement in the fake gold scam. Mr Haji issued a statement on Saturday about a recording circulated on social media that suggests that some information was relayed to President Kenyatta, Mr Odinga and Interior minister Fred Matiang'i, and that discussions followed. He condemned the release and circulation of the recording, saying, "Such claims and their circulation through social media, specifically through leaked phone recordings in today's age of real-tme, borderless publishing, are alarmist and may needlessly cause disaffection He warned that "unless all facts are obtained and analysed, it is irresponsible and possibly unlawful to publish such material." SPEEDY PROBE Mr Haji said he had personally received complaints from victims who said the person behind the scam had been invoking the President's name in dealings and conversations. "Having realised that they were conned on the availability of the gold, and the misleading knowledge and involvement of the President, the former Prime Minister and CS Matiang’i, they resolved to [file] a report [with] Kenyan authorities and cooperate with law enforcement in unearthing the under-dealings.” The DPP said he had thus directed Inspector-General of Police Hilary Mutyambai to speed up the probe; he said the file should be forwarded to him in the next seven days. Mr Haji also asked members of the public with helpful information to report it to authorities.
