Leaders affiliated to both Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga factions within the ruling Jubilee Party have been accused of neglecting their duties and engaging in unnecessary politics and leaving their electorates without leadership. Murang’a County Assembly Majority Leader Eric Kamande said the factions are on the verge of crippling services to the electorate and pleaded with them to stop politicking and serve the people. Speaking Sunday in Kandiri village where he had gone to open a three-bedroomed house which he built for a needy family, Mr Kamande said it is unfortunate that Kenyans have to found themselves in a fix due to the factional politics among their leaders. AVAILABLE IN CHURCHES “It is unfortunate that leaders affiliating themselves to either Kieleweke or Tanga Tanga factions are only available in churches on Sundays and not in their constituencies, a move that has left the electorate with no leader to cater for their needs. Let them remember that they will be re-elected based on their performance and not their political affiliation,” he said. Mr Kamande said he has been building houses for disadvantaged people in his Kahumbu Ward and called on well-wishers to chip in to uplift the living standards of the poor. NINTH PROJECT “This is my ninth project and I would like to urge people who have excelled in businesses to engage in corporate social responsibility to uplift the living standards of the poor. You don’t have to be elected to build a house for the poor or even sponsor a child in school,” he noted. On his part, the beneficiary, Dominic Kamau, narrated how he had roofed his one-roomed mud-walled house, in which he lived with his six children, with tattered clothes. “My family and I are very delighted because we used to live in a deplorable state but we now have a three-bedroomed house furnished with household items. We thank the well-wishers for the kind gesture and saving us from the agony of living in such a house during the rainy season,” he said.
