Champions Kenya Commercial Bank and Kabras Sugar will meet for the third consecutive year in Kenya Cup final. After suffering a shock 11-10 loss to Impala in the Enterprise Cup semi-finals last weekend, KCB touched down six tries to dismantle Kenya Harlequin 46-13 at the KCB Ruaraka grounds on Saturday.   At Kakamega Showground, hosts Kabras Sugar weathered stubborn Mwamba's storm winning 23-11 to set up another showdown with KCB in the final. The Kenya Cup final will staged on May 25 at the Kakamega Showground. Flanker Andrew Amonde and fullback Isaac Njoroge scored a brace of tries each while hooker Peter Kaaria, and substitute prop Griffin Musila managed a try each to put KCB in the final. Winger Jacob Ojee, who had a stunning performance with the boot, made five conversions and scored two penalties. Substitute back Peter Misango and fly-half Eden Agero scored a try each for Quins as full back Eric Shikuku managed a penalty but all was in vain. "The loss to Impala last weekend was a wake up call as we improved on our set-pieces and defence to defeat Quins who proved stubborn especially in the first half," said KCB skipper Curtis Lilako. Backs Felix Ayange and Mario Wilson's tries are what Kabras needed to storm into the Kenya Cup final for a fourth consecutive year. Philip Wokorach finished it off with three penalties and a conversion. Daniel Taabu made one try while Tony Omondi scored two penalties but Mwamba fell short.
