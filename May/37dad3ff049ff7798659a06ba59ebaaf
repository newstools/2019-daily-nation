RIO DE JANEIRO Hosts Brazil included injured defender Thiago Silva in their squad for the Copa America, coach Tite announced on Friday. Paris Saint-Germain's Silva, 34, has been suffering from a knee issue since mid-April but Brazil's physio Fabio Mahseredjian said the former captain could be in a "good condition" by May 28. The world's most expensive player Neymar was also included having returned from more than two months on the sidelines with a foot problem. There was no space for Tottenham's Champions League hero Lucas Moura despite his hat-trick in last week's semi-final second leg against Ajax nor for Real Madrid youngster Vinicius Junior. Everton winger Richarlison is included in the 23-man group after an impressive season in the English top flight. The eight-time winners face Bolivia, Venezuela and Peru in the group stage, which start on June 14, after two friendlies against Qatar and Honduras.
