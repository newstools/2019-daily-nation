A Chuka court has ordered nine suspects in the murder of a chief in Tharaka-Nithi to undergo mental assessment before taking plea on May 23. The suspects, Gerald Njeru Kibau, Julius Mburu Kinanga, Leah Muthoni Ngige, Cecilia Kaambura, Julius Njeru, Jediel Munyua, Tom Kinyua, John Nthiga and Jornard Njagi Kibiube are accused of killing Kamaindi Location Chief Japheth Mayau Mukengu. The nine were arrested on diverse days and have been in police custody. Chief Magistrate John Njoroge Thursday said the case will proceed at the High Court before Judge Robert Limo. The nine are linked to the murder of the chief on April 30, 2019 at his brother Gikware Mukengu’s home within Kamaindi Location. DISPUTE According to a police report, the chief had been sent by Igambang’ombe Deputy County Commissioner Fred Masinjila to settle a dispute between his brother and a villager when he was hacked to death and his body burnt. The chief is expected to be buried at his Kamaindi home Friday. The incident also led to the murder of Chuka OCS Joseph Kinyua as he was pursuing a suspect in Ugweri in the neighbouring Embu County. BURIED Mr Kinyua, who was buried in Mathira, Nyeri County last Friday, was hacked to death with an axe by a suspect, David Ikaba, who was also shot dead. The burial was attended by top police officers, led by Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua. A police informer, who had accompanied the OCS to Ugweri market, was attacked by members of public and seriously injured. He later succumbed to the injuries while receiving treatment at Tenri Hospital in Embu and his body was buried last week in Kamaindi. Five suspects in the murder of the OCS were arraigned in Embu and are being held in police custody as investigations continue.
