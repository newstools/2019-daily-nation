Taxpayers will spend Sh152.4 million to complete the refurbishment of Deputy President William Ruto's second home in Mombasa County before the 2022 general elections. In November 2018, the Office of the Deputy President sought to hire a contractor to upgrade the former residence of the Coast provincial commissioner and turn it into Dr Ruto's official home. The National Treasury will allocate Sh37.4 million starting July for renovation of the building next to State House, on top of the Sh39 million allocated for the upgrade in the financial year ending June. It has budgeted for Sh76 million in the two years to the 2022 general election, bringing the total to Sh152.4 million. STATUS The contractor is expected to refurbish the unoccupied house to befit the status of the Deputy President. Samuel Kilele, a former Coast PC and regional coordinator, was the last occupant of the house. A tender notice from the Office of the Deputy President is for the "proposed completion of the refurbishment works to the former PCâ€™s home, Mombasa, for HE the Deputy President". During official working tours in the Coast, Dr Ruto is expected to put up at the new residence as opposed to staying at beach hotels as has been the case in the past. SECOND OFFICE Taxpayers will also part with additional billions to build a second office in Mombasa for the second most powerful man in the country. The government opted against leasing an office for Dr Ruto in that county on security grounds, prompting plans to build the block. The DP's main office is on Harambee Avenue in Nairobi. KAREN RESIDENCE In Nairobi, Dr Ruto has preferred to reside at his private home instead of the palatial Karen property that sits on a 10-acre piece of land. The Deputy President uses the Sh400 million Karen residence for official functions, especially the hosting of political delegations. The Karen residence will be refurbished at Sh15.6 million and the Harambee Avenue office at Sh35 million.
