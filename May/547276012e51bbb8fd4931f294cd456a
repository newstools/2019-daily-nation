The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) on Thursday advised motorists in the coastal region to use Kombani-Kwale-Kinango-Lunga Lunga route after floods cut off Mombasa-Lunga Lunga road near Mwangei. "Motorists and other road users should exercise caution and avoid the raging floodwaters," says Mr Charles Njogu, Assistant Director of Corporate Communications.
