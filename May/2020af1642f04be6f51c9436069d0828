An Administration Police officer attached to Nairobi’s Umoja II post on Sunday shot himself dead under unclear circumstances. The male officer’s body was discovered by his fellow officers at around 7am when they went to his house to inquire why he had not reported to work. DEATH Kamukunji sub-county Police Commander Adamson Bungei confirmed the death of the officer, whom he could not name since his next of kin had not been informed. He said that the incident happened at around 7am at the Umoja II AP camp. “The incident occurred at around 7am but we cannot reveal the name of the officer now because the next of kin has not been informed of the death,” said Mr Bungei on Sunday. Mr Bungei said investigations have commenced. UMOJA ESTATE “Investigations have commenced, we are piecing together everything that happened within the vicinity to help us unravel the mystery behind the death,” he said. READ: Parliament police woman found dead The incident comes just a day after a female police officer identified as Constable Hellen Kwamboka, who was based at Parliament Police Station, was found dead in her house in Umoja Estate. Mr Bungei decried the increasing cases of deaths, saying that there are better ways of solving disputes. “It is quite unfortunate as he did not complain about anything, we are trying to find out what could have happened,” he said. DISTURBED But one of the officer’s colleagues alleged that the dead officer was a disturbed man who seemed to be going through some marital problems. He said this might have made their colleague to take his life. “He differed with his wife after advancing her some loan. We suspect this might have led to him shoot himself. He left a suicide note,” said the officer. The death of the officer brings to four the number of law enforcers who have died in the last one month. The other officers are Ms Caroline Chepchirchir Chesire, who was murdered in Nakuru, and Ms Pauline Wangari who was murdered in Murang’a.
