The high court on Wednesday barred nine individuals from beginning their duties at the boards of Postal Corporation of Kenya and Tana and Athi River Development Authority (TARDA). Justice John Mativo issued the directive after a lobby consisting of lawyers, dubbed Chama Cha Mawakili, disputed the appointments made by Information Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru. "Pending the hearing and determination of this case, a conservatory order be and is hereby issued prohibiting the appointed persons from assuming offices for which they have been appointed by the CS in terms of gazette notices 4334 and 4359," Justice Mativo said, adding that the matter will be addressed on priority basis. REGIONAL BALANCE Those appointed to Postal Corporation are: Mr Mike Rubia, Mr Fred Gachie Ngángá, Mr Munyua Waiyaki, Mr Simon Kiuta, Ms Pauline Muthangani. Those selected to join TARDA include Mr Robert Murimi, Ms Jane Muriithi Githinji and Mr Ndogo Waweru. They are all listed as interested parties in the case. The lobby sued Mr Mucheru and the Attorney General arguing that the appointments, gazetted on May 3, were made without considering regional balance. Through lawyer Paul Ogendi, they observed that ethnic balance is critical in fostering nationhood, cohesion and peace. Thus, they said the minister's action threatens social and economic growth. The case will mentioned on June 5.
