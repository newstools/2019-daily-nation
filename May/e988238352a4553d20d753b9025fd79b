The death toll from the Sunday night Wajir bus accident along the Mwingi-Garissa road has risen to 14. At least 10 people died on the spot after the Wajir-bound Nasib Sacco bus collided with a trailer at Tula area, between Bangal and Garissa town. Two more succumbed on the way to hospital and two others died while receiving treatment. Some 15 people who sustained serious injuries are admitted at the Garissa Referral Hospital. The accident occured a few minutes to midnight on Sunday. Reports indicate the bus, with 50 passengers on board, was trying to overtake another vehicle when it rammed the trailer that had stalled on the road to avoid a head-on collision with an oncoming car. The trailer transporting cement tore into the bus and ripped away windows and a section of the roof, injuring many. The dead include six women and eight eight men. Those with minor injuries have been treated and discharged. Eye witnesses said the lorry had developed mechanical problem causing it to stall on the road. - Additional reporting by Amina Wako.
