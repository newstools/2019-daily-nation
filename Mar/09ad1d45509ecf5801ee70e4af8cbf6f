Mathare United on Saturday blew a big chance to move to the summit of the SportPesa Premier League after battling to a barren draw with Western Stima at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Mathare are now a point below leaders Bandari, who have two games in hand and face Ulinzi Stars on Sunday in Nakuru. The Slum Boys dominated proceedings at Kasarani but they were unlucky not to bag maximum points thanks to fantastic goalkeeping from Western Stima’s Stephen Otieno. Johnstone Omurwa had the first real chance of the game as early as the seventh minute but he missed a free header from close range after Kevin Kimani had picked him out with a sumptuous delivery from a corner. Disciplined defensive play from the visitors restricted the hosts to few chances in the opening half but James Kinyanjui should have done better after a training ground free-kick routine came off brilliantly. Kimani played a clever pass into the path of Kinyanjui from a free-kick. The winger took a neat touch to create space for himself in the box but his shot went straight at Otieno. Francis Kimanzi sought attacking inspiration from the pair of John Mwangi and Ronald Reagan in the second half yet the tale of missed chances persisted. Reagan’s acrobatic effort went inches wide after connecting to a low cross from Kimani and moments later, Otieno produced arguably the save of the match, going full stretch to his left to palm Kinyanjui’s curler to safety. Tyson Otieno also had a go at goal but his effort was always rising after Kinynajui found him with a cutback. A frustrating afternoon for Kimanzi’s charges was capped by another miss from Mwangi after Kimani’s dipping cross found him at the back post. Mwangi however had a poor connection and the chance went begging with five minutes left.   Second half substitute Amini Muzerwa struck a late consolation for Tusker in a controversial manner.
