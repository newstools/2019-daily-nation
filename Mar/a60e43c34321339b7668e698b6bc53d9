Doctors in Homa Bay on Friday evening suspended their strike after a deal with the county, agreeing to return to work immediately. Their industrial action over delayed salaries and poor conditions had lasted about three weeks. The doctors signed a return-to-work agreement in a meeting presided over by County Secretary Isaiah Ogwe; County Health minister Richard Muga; Kevin Osuri, the Nyanza chairman of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union; and County KMPDU Liaison Officer Amos Dulo. The KMPDU officials directed members to return to work in the agreement read by Mr Dulo. PROMISES Homa Bay promised to pay the doctors' salaries by the fifth day of every month and to complete the re-designation and promotion of all qualified union members by the end of March. “The county and KMPDU commit, in good faith, to the ongoing meetings on the implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement," the liaison officer said. Dr Osuri asked union members to resume duty no later than Monday, promising that none of them would be victimised. FIRST PRIORITY Mr Ogwe said the county would strive to meet the doctor's demands to prevent strikes in future. “We have always given health the first priority because it is a sector on which our well-being depends. We will continue to [protect] the welfare of all health workers and enhance service delivery,” he said. Prof Muga told the doctors to always go to his office should they have concerns about their welfare. "My office is open for discussions. We assure that February salaries will have been paid by March 8. This will help us end the thorny issue of salary delays,” he said. The termination of the doctors' strike came days after nurses in Homa Bay and several other counties resolved to return to work. Patients had been bearing high costs of medication and treatment in private facilities.   Health workers call off strike a day after President Kenyatta and ODM leader urged them to return to work.
