Andre Cassa Mbungo finally masterminded his first win as AFC Leopards coach as the big cats beat Sony Sugar 1-0 in a SportPesa Premier League match at Bukhungu Stadium on Saturday. It was a day of many firsts as goalscorer Wayi Yeka was also on the scoresheet for the first time in Leopards colours. Initially, the ball looked like it had deflected off Andrew Waiswa's feet before hitting the back of the net but centre referee Zachariah Ashira awarded the goal to Yeka. After the match, Sony coach Patrick Odhiambo blamed his players for the loss, sayin they should have converted the numerous scoring opportunities they created. “We were as good as our opponents. But the best team won at the end of the day,” he said. “We played well. The journey has just started. I target to perform well in the second leg of the league,” an elated Mbungo said. Both teams went all out in attack from the onset and the visitors could have taken the lead as early as the fifth minute when Derrick Okanga’s header was parried over the cross bar by custodian Jairus Andira. It was a see-saw affair for the better part of the game as the teams went into half time tied 0-0. As the second half resumed, Leoaprds came into play a more refined side and in the 47th minute Whyvonne Isuza floated the ball in the box before the Wayi Yeka buried the ball for the solitary goal.   Leaders Bandari failed to pull away from second placed Gor Mahia after battling to a barren draw with Mathare United in a tension-filled SportPesa Premier League match at the KPA Mbaraki Sports Club on Saturday.
