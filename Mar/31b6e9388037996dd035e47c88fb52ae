Italian Guido Migliozzi on Sunday completed a four rounds total of 16 under par 268 to claim the 2019 Magical Kenya Open golf title at the par 71 Karen Country Club course. The 22-year-old Migliozzi, who has so far made three cuts in the European Tour’s Race to Dubai, carded two under par 69 in the final to post his maiden victory in the European Tour, where he is now ranked 28, and 576 in the world. “It was very exciting playing in front of such a big crowd but more so, receiving the trophy from the President of the country. I felt so great and will definitely come back next year to defend my title," said Migliozzi, who turned professional in 2016 at plus four handicap. He said he got some few tips from compatriot and defending champion Lorenzo Gagli, who also gave him one club, which he said helped him a lot. “I broke my club so I borrowed a two-iron from him which I used to drive in most of the holes and I am real happy winning this event. The course is very nice and the people very friendly here," added Migliozzi, who bogeyed the fourth and ninth, but made four birdies for the day, two in the outward nine and two at the back nine’s 10th and 12th holes, having birdied the fourth and fifth in the front nine. He played a conservative back nine, collecting pars in the last six holes including at the home green which he really needed to assure himself of victory and avoid a possible play off. He beat Spain’s Adri Arnaus, South Africa’s Louis De Jager and Justin Harding by one shot. The victory earned him 183,330 Euros (about Sh20.5 million), his biggest win in his short career. With the Magical Kenya Open done, Migliozzi is now heading to Malaysia for the 3 million dollar Maybank Championship in Kuala Lumpur this Wednesday. Meanwhile, Arnaus fired one under par 70 in a round that included four birdies on the fourth and fifth and 11th and 15th for an all rounds total of 15 under par 269 to tie for second place with the two South Africans. Of the two, De Jager carded two under 69 which included birdies on the fifth, sixth and 11th having dropped the only shot of the day at the second hole, while his colleague Harding, who last weekend won the Commercial Bank of Qatar Masters title made birdies on the ninth and 11th, an eagle at the 12th that was followed by a bogey at the 13th, though he added two more birdies on the 15tgh and 17th for an impressive 66 to make his 269. The three players won 82.027 Euros each for tying second, while finishing in fifth place on his own, was India’s Bhullar Gaganjeet who also carded 66 in the final round for 14 under par 270. A field of 74 players had made the second cut in the event which attracted a field of 144 players including six amateurs.
