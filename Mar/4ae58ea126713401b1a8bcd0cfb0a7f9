Captanne (James Muhindi), trained by Oliver Gray, was the only horse who seemed to not worry about conditions, winning the Mijikenda Kaya Forests Maiden, by seven lengths, with plenty to spare. Otherwise, times were faster than usual, at Ngong, on Sunday, regardless of what they all had to face. Joe Muya had a sweet treble with Harbour Bay, Go Pro, and, La Cha Cha, while Patsy Sercombe replicated that with White Dragon, Gold Pot, and, Compadre. White Dragon sat quietly behind Pharoah's Advocate and Clothes Horse, as they rallied away in the Tankard Trophy. Then, Lesley Sercombe asked the question of White Dragon, with a fruity answer for Mrs Michael Spencer. 1.15 pm - First Race - World Heritage Sites Handicap (900m) 1. Compadre (Lesley Sercombe) 2.
