Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey will miss the opening Euro 2020 qualifier against Slovakia on Sunday after failing to recover from injury. The 28-year-old Arsenal player has been withdrawn from the squad and returned to his club for treatment. Ramsey did not feature in his country's 1-0 friendly win over Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday. "We have plan B and we've worked on it during the week," said Wales manager Ryan Giggs. "He was in good form but it gives a chance for someone else." Wales have been boosted by the news that Bournemouth midfielder David Brooks has been passed fit after the 21-year-old missed Wednesday's game with an ankle knock. Ramsey's absence could also open up an opportunity for Matt Smith, Lee Evans or Will Vaulks to play a key role in Sunday's match. Defender Ethan Ampadu and forwards Sam Vokes and Tom Lawrence also missed Wednesday's friendly and are unlikely to feature against Slovakia.
