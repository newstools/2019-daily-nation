A motorist on Friday died after his car collided with a lorry near Naivasha Maximum Security Prison on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The driver and his turnboy sustained serious injuries and are being treated at Naivasha Sub-County Hospital. A witness, Mr Peter Karanja, said the 6am incident occurred when the motorist attempted to overtake. "The motorist did not have a clear view of the oncoming traffic before the smash-up," he said. Naivasha divisional police commander Samuel Waweru added that the motorist died while being treated at the hospital. The crash comes four days after five family members perished on the same road when returning to Nairobi from a funeral in Kisumu.   Car collides with bus as church members head to Nairobi from Kisumu.
