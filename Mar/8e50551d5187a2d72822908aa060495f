Families of the victims of the ill-fated Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302 Boeing 737 Max jet have asked the government to make their lives easier as they mourn their loved ones. Some families asked the government to assist them to get compensation through legal representation, while others asked the State to speed up the process of determining the DNA of their relatives. However, some of the grieving families had mixed feelings about government's support. The family of Immaculate Odera says that they have been left on their own following the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash that claimed the lives of 36 Kenyans. BEREAVED Speaking during a meeting between bereaved families and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi, on Thursday, Ms Oderaâ€™s widower Denis Adhoch said that he was concerned that his family and others had been left on their own.
