Kenya’s poor performance in the World Rugby Sevens Series is worrying. From a high of winning the Singapore Sevens in 2017, the team has been on a steady decline. Currently, Kenya sits 13th in the World Rugby Sevens Series with 17 points, just two places above the relegation zone. Since the season started last November, Kenya has played in five legs of the 10-leg world series, collecting just 17 points midway through the competition. The team did not win a single match in its pool in Dubai, Cape Town and Sydney, and has failed to reach the Main Cup quarter-finals since the season began. A tougher test awaits the team in the sixth leg of the series today in Canada, where it will play the hosts Fiji and Samoa. Any slip-up could spell doom for the team in the series, with Wales and Japan waiting on the wings to cash in on any mistakes by Kenya, to avoid relegation. Other than Kenyan athletes, the rugby team has been an effective tool of marketing the country to the rest of the world. At the heart of Kenya’s problems is a demotivated squad missing senior players who walked out on the team due to pay disputes, lack of structures to create a pool of talented players to choose from, a broke federation that has failed to attract sponsorships and a high turnover of coaches. The most urgent thing to do now is to save the team from imminent relegation. The Kenya Rugby Union must put its house in order and make long-term plans if the country is to regain her lost glory in rugby. South Africa, Samoa, Fiji and New Zealand have fielded younger teams in the series this season, riding on the back of vibrant academies that produce quality players. Establishing academies could be a good starting point for the Kenya Rugby Union. Proper management of the team is paramount.
