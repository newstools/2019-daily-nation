The singer, actress and producer Jennifer Lopez and former US baseball player Alex Rodriguez are engaged. The couple – widely known as J-Lo and A-Rod – have been together for two years. Lopez – who's known for hits like “Love Don't Cost A Thing” and “Jenny From The Block” – shared a picture of her engagement ring on Instagram. Former New York Yankee Rodriguez shared the same photo on Twitter, with the words "she said yes". The pair celebrated their two-year anniversary in February. To mark the occasion, Lopez shared a gallery of five photos on social media, alongside a caption detailing her love for Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who is now a TV commentator, revealed in October that he had long been a fan of Lopez. He posted a photo of a poster she signed for him 20 years ago. This will be Lopez's fourth marriage and Rodriguez's second. A wedding date has yet to be confirmed.
