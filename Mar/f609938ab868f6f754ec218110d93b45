New Sports, Culture and Heritage Cabinet Secretary Ambassador Amina Mohammed on Tuesday morning officially took over from her predecessor Rashid Echesa in a short ceremony at the ministry's headquarters at Kencom House, Nairobi. Echesa was sacked by President Uhuru Kenyatta in a mini cabinet reshuffle on Friday morning. Echesa’s surprise appointment to head the Sports Ministry came about a year ago. A source close to the Cabinet Secretary told Nation Sport that Mohammed is excited to continue serving Kenyans at yet another important ministry. “She is looking forward to meet sports federation officials and national teams and chat the way forward for sports,” she said. Handing over the reins to Mohammed, Rashid Echesa took the opportunity to wish Mohammed best of luck and thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto for having given him the opportunity to serve the country. “This morning at the official handover ceremony of the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage to the incoming Cabinet Secretary Amb. Amina Mohamed,” said Echesa on Facebook. “Let me once again thank the President and his Deputy President for considering me amongst 50 million Kenyans to serve my country in the capacity,” said Echesa. The 57-year-old Amina, who was the Education CS before the surprise appointment on Friday, takes over at the ministry in a year that major sporting events are coming up. The World Cross Country Championships go down on March 30 in Aarhus, Denmark while the national football team, Harambee Stars, is expected to end their 15-year wait for Africa Cup of Nations action in Egypt in June. The country is also expected to grace the IAAF World Championships set for Doha, Qatar later this year among other sporting events.
