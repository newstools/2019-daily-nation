A magistrate has dismissed an application by former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, challenging graft charges brought against him. In a ruling on Monday, Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti said the charges against Dr Kidero met the threshold required by law. He said no evidence was placed before him to convince him to interfere with the charges. The court also dismissed an application by directors of companies alleged to have fraudulently received payments from City Hall. CORRUPTION The directors challenged the move to charge them together with the companies. In the application, Dr Kidero challenged charges of conspiracy to commit corruption arguing that it was faulty. He also sought to be charged separately arguing that the charges were lumped together with an aim of embarrassing him.
