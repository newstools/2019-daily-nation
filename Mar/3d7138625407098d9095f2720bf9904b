Hi Brenda, I dated a guy who wanted to marry me but I went through his Facebook profile and saw posts of him flirting with a girl. I confronted him only for him to say that I should ask the girl who she is to him. I only needed clarification. It's not like I was insecure but he seemed to think I was.  Hi, You are not insecure. So is this guy the kind of guy who likes flirting? Was it serious flirting, with intent to follow through? There's a difference, I believe, but I also believe that when someone shows you who they are, you should believe them. He says he wants to marry you. Has he done anything towards that general direction, like proposed, chosen dates, or met with your family? Who else has he told about your impending nuptials? Is he also telling this other girl that he will marry her? Watch what he does, not what he says. Talk is cheap. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
