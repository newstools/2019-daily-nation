Collins Kipyegon, the son of the late former Cabinet minister Kipkalya Kones and Bomet East MP Beatrice Kones, has died in a suspected case of suicide. Nakuru County Commander Simon Matu said on Friday that Rongai divisional police commander Japheth Kioko informed him that they were probing suicide. Sources told the Nation that on Thursday night, Mr Kipyegon posted messages on social media that were seen as warning signs. The 39-year-old reportedly said he was tired of life. A source who sought anonymity as he is not the family spokesperson said, â€œThere is the claim that Collins had a disagreement with his wife and that moments later, he posted on social media that he would kill himself." RESCUE Friends who read Mr Kipyegon's message rushed to their house in Ngata on the outskirts of Nakuru County, some 13 kilometres from Nakuru town. Mr Kipyegon's close relatives, who did not want to be named, said the friends broke into the house and found him unconscious. They took him to Nakuru War Memorial Hospital where he died as doctors tried to save his life. On receiving news of her son's death, Mrs Kones returned from South Africa where she had been attending a pan-African parliamentary meeting. Former Deputy State House Comptroller Franklin Bett and leaders from Kericho and Bomet were among people who went to the mortuary to view Mr Kipyegon's body. He was the third born in a family of five.   WHO has targeted a 10 percent cut in global suicide rates by 2020.
