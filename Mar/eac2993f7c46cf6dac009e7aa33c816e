A Nigerian woman was arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi on Sunday after she was found with packets of suspected narcotics. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) reported this via Twitter on Monday, saying Princess Okoye was a suspected drug trafficker. The DCI said Ms Okoye, 25, was found with 77 pellets of suspected narcotics, in packets that had been hidden in two bottles of milk. "Upon being placed under observation, she emitted an additional 15 pellets," the tweet stated. Ms Okoye, apprehended while preparing to take a flight to Italy, will remain under observation as the DCI investigates her case.     On February 25, detectives seized heroin worth Sh1.5 million at the JKIA. The consignment destined for Guinea was disguised as a generator spare part, the DCI said. Many arrests have been at the city airport and other parts of the country, even as statistics indicate that thousands of Kenyans are addicted to drugs. According to the National Authority for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse, 24,500 people are addicted to drugs in Mombasa alone, pointing to a greater problem in the country.   DCI detective seize 31 pellets of the narcotics.
