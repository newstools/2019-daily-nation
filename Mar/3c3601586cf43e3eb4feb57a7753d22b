A court has acquitted a British citizen who was charged with trafficking Sh598 million worth of cocaine into the country. Justice Luka Kimaru on Thursday said the prosecution withdrew charges against Mr Jack Alexander Wolf Marrian after concluding that he is a victim of a global drug trafficking syndicate. Justice Kimaru then ordered that the drugs seized by police during his arrest be destroyed within 14 days under the supervision of a Nairobi magistrate court.
