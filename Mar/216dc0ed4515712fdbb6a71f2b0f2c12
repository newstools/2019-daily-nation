Nine people have been charged before Migori Magistrates Court with killing five members of a family. The five, who included two women and three children, were burnt beyond recognition when irate villagers torched their houses last Thursday in Nyang'ao village in Rongo, Migori County. The villagers had accused the victims of practising witchcraft. The nine suspects, who appeared before Migori Principal Magistrate Moses Obiero on Monday, were arrested over the weekend after police launched a manhunt for the killers. The suspects, who included Lucas Nyandiga, Joash Onyango, Ben Omondi, John Odika, Joseph Ogilo, Mary Ouma, Benson Nyangwara, Benard Ouma and Collins Odhiambo, did not take plea and were remanded at Migori Police Station. ATTACKED Mr Obiero gave the police 14 days to complete their investigations. Rongo Sub County Police Commander Kibet Kirui said the police were still pursuing more suspects. "We are still searching for more suspects even as investigations continue," said Mr Kirui. Trouble started when one Mr Joel Awuonda was attacked with machetes following a protracted family squabble which started last year. In December last year, the assailant, named Omondi, was jailed for 12 years by Rongo Magistrate Court. The residents allege that last week, Mr Elijah Dwallo, the convict’s father, threatened to 'kill' Mr Awuonda for causing the imprisonment of his son. DIED On Thursday evening, residents said, Mr Awuonda, who later died, suddenly fell ill and attempts to seek help from a traditional healer alleged that his ‘ailment’ had been caused by Mr Dwallo's family. A group of irate villagers descended on Mr Dwallo’s homestead at night and burnt houses, killing the five people. The case will be mentioned on March 18, 2019.   They were burnt beyond recognition in the Thursday night raid.
