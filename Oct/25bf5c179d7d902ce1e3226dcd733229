Coached by Sammy Okoth working alongside Nick Yakhama, the Vihiga County Government-sponsored side are fourth followed by Migori Youth in the top five, with both sides level on 16 points. Former heavyweights Shabana, who are ninth with 13 points, drew 0-0 with Vihiga Bullets in a crowd-puller at Kakamega’s Bukhungu Stadium, as Mount Kenya United edged Ushuru 2-1. Speaking after the match at Camp Toyoyo, City Stars assistant coach, John Amboko said their aim is to qualify for next season’s KPL. “The boys have vowed to continue working hard and win matches,” said Amboko after leading the Jonathan Jackson Foundation-sponsored outfit to victory. Amboko was on the touchline in the absence of head coach Sanjin Alagic who was away in his homeland, Bosnia Herzegovina. “We have started preparing for our next fixture against Nairobi Stima on Wednesday. We expect the encounter to be explosive,” said the former AFC Leopards defender.
