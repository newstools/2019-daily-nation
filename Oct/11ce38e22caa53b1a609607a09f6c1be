A trader in Ngurubani in Mwea, Kirinyaga County, was electrocuted on Tuesday evening while fixing her TVâ€™s aerial on the roof. Winnie Wambui, 23, was trying to adjust the aerial, which had been blown off by a strong wind. She died on the spot. Residents said Wambui accidentally touched an exposed live wire while trying to fix the aerial. Assistant Chief Henry Kariuki said he arrived a few minutes after receiving the report only to find the trader already dead. The incident comes barely five months after a mother and her son were electrocuted in the same area. Police took the body of the victim to Mwea Mission Hospital mortuary.
