Britain's National Crime Agency on Wednesday said an investigation into one of the country's worst ever child sex offenders had led to the arrest of 337 suspects in 38 countries. The agency said in a statement the arrests followed the removal of a "dark web" site run from South Korea, which "monetised the sexual abuse of children", where paedophiles paid in cryptocurrency.
