Ms Evalyne Akinyi Ayugi appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Hezron Nyaberi at the Winam Law Courts on Thursday. But she failed to take plea after the officer investigating the case asked for more time to conclude investigations. The investigating officer had asked for 14 days to record statements but the magistrate directed he should do so within seven says. “The case will be brought before the court on October 3 and the investigating officer should prepare the reports,” said the magistrate. The suspect is expected to take plea on Thursday next week.
