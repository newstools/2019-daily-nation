A 52-year-old widow was allegedly hacked to death by her lover in Suba North, Homa Bay County. The body of Ms Susan Adhiambo Otieno was found in her house in Ogongo Tir Village in Lambwe West Location on Friday morning by neighbours who responded to her distress calls. She was allegedly stabbed four times on her shoulder, mouth and arm by Mr Joshua Obembi who is said to have inherited her after the death of her husband in 2014. Mr Obembi, who has since been arrested, is said to have murdered the woman on suspicion that his younger brother also had a love affair with Ms Otieno. LOVE AFFAIRS The suspect is said to have gone to the widow’s house in the middle of the night and attacked her. “We heard him accusing the woman of engaging in love affairs with his brother,” a witness claimed. Area Chief Daniel Obure said when the neighbours arrived, the woman was already dead. “Her body was lying in a pool of blood on the floor, the suspect had disappeared into the darkness when we got there,” Mr Obure said. FIGHTING The chief said the woman is said to have had an affair with the two brothers. “There are reports that the two brothers were fighting over the women,” Me Obure said. The administrator added that he had tried to talk to the widow to keep off the two men. Mr Obembi was arrested and taken to Mbita Police Station on Friday, while his brother is at large. Ms Otieno’s body was moved to Homa Bay County Hospital mortuary.
