Specialised engineering teams are expected to Thursday begin pulling out the vehicle that was carrying a woman and her child, and which lunged into the Indian Ocean at the Likoni channel 11 days ago. The car, which Ms Mariam Kighenda and her daughter Amanda Mutheu were in when it slipped off MV Harambee on September 29 at around 6:13pm, was found following efforts by a multi-agency team. The announcement was a big relief to the family of Mr John Wambua who have been camping at Likoni. Here is what we know so far on the retrieval efforts: The rescue team identified the vehicle between 1pm and 2pm Wednesday when they were reviewing 3D films captured during the morning session. Sources said the car is lying 58 metres deep, and will now require specialised engineering teams to pull it out. The vehicle drifted 40 metres away from where it had plunged into the ocean, according to Kenya Ferry Service (KFS) officials.
