Ghanaian striker Francis Afriyie will lead the hunt for goals as Gor Mahia take on Nzoia Sugar in a Kenyan Premier League match Wednesday afternoon in Mumias. The Ghanaian has only started one match since he joined the club as he’s been battling injuries, but he seems to be okay now and has been handed a start in a squad that sees Tanzanian goalkeeper back David Mapigano in the starting 11 after he was benched in K’Ogalo’s 2-0 loss to USM Alger in the return leg of the first round Caf Champions League match on Sunday. Kenneth Muguna will as usual captain the team, while Clifton Miheso and Boniface Omondi are expected to provide the assists from the flanks. For the hosts', goalkeeper Humphrey Katasi will lead the team, while as usual Leonard Kasembeli and Collins Wakhungu will lead the onslaught. The match kicks off at 3 pm.
