At least 10 General Service Unit (GSU) officers were killed on Saturday after their vehicle ran over an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) on Degoh Road in Garissa County. The officers from Harehare GSU Camp were on patrol along the Kenya-Somalia border when their Toyota Land Cruiser ran over the IED suspected to have been planted by Al Shabaab militants. In a statement, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai said a joint patrol team of Kenya Defence Forces, Administration Police, Rapid Response Police Unit and Kenya Police Service had been dispatched to the area to pursue the attackers. “The National Police Service regrets to inform the public that NPS officers were on patrol along Damajale-Harehare Road near the Kenya-Somali border when their motor vehicle ran over an Improvised Explosive Device,” the statement reads. In June this year, at least four people were killed after their vehicle ran over an IED in the border town of Kulan, Garissa. The staff from ADESO, a non-governmental organisation working in Somalia, were going to their offices in Dobley.
