The burial ceremony of the late Mariam Kighenda and her daughter Amanda Mutheu, who drowned in the Indian Ocean three weeks ago, is underway in Makueni. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana, his deputy Adelina Mwau, Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior are among the leaders in attendance. The vehicle plunged into the ocean after it slid off ferry MV Harambee on September 29. Kighenda was from her farm in Gasi, Msambweni, Kwale County, and was heading home when the tragedy occurred. The vehicle was retrieved on Friday last week after a 13-day search that involved a multi-agency team of divers, including privately hired ones from SubSea, a South African company. Police have so far questioned seven people, including the ferryâ€™s coxswain, two deckhand officials, a ramp controller and two guards from Guard Force. The seven recorded their statements with Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers at Likoni Police Station.
