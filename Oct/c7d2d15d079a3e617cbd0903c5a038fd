IN DOHA Ferguson Rotich on Tuesday claimed bronze in1:43.82 in the men's 800m in a race won by American Donovan Brazier at the 2019 Doha World Championships. The 22-year-old American stormed home in a new championship record 1min 42.34sec ahead of Amel Tuka of Bosnia who took silver while Rotich settled for bronze after a late charge at the Khalifa Stadium. Brazier, a runner of the Nike-backed Oregon project training group whose leader Alberto Salazar was banned for four years for doping offences earlier Tuesday, also obliterated the American National Record of 1min 60sec set by Johnny Gray 34 years ago. Rotich remained a lone ranger in the 800m final after the other two Kenyans - Emmanuel Kori and Kipngetich Ngeno - failed to make it past the semi-finals. Tuka took silver in 1:43.47. The American is one of the athletes at the World Championships who train with the Nike-backed Oregon Project in Portland, USA. Salazar was on Tuesday banned from attending the World Championships in Doha.
