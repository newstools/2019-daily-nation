KU will however continue their search for the elusive win on Sunday with a tie against fellow students and bottom-placed Jomo Kenyatta University Agricultural Technology at 3pm. CONCEDED DEFEAT KU coach Richard Wandera conceded defeat but remained optimistic ahead of clash against JKUAT. “Our performance in the first quarter was wanting but I’m glad we regrouped in the remaining quarters and although we didn’t score we were a better side it’s only that we didn’t use our chances,” Wandera said. “I have a feeling on Sunday that elusive win will finally come home and we look forward to the match. We have always played well but it’s unfortunate we haven’t been able to win.” His opposite number Thomas Mucheni said the title is Telkom's to lose and their focus is to finish second. Mucheni said they are glad they took their chances in the first two quarters since the players didn’t turn up in the last quarters. “KU were a better side in the second half but I’m happy we scored early in the game and we have the three points. Our strategy has always been to attack from the onset and the tactics paid off again today. The title is already gone and we are chasing the second position but we will have to take one game at a time,” said Mucheni. Record holders Telkom and rivals Strathmore University occupy the first two positions on the standings with 26 and 18 points from 10 and 11 matches respectively although they are not in action this weekend.
