Kenyan champions Gor Mahia will face Democratic Republic of Congo's DC Motema Pembe in the Caf Confederation Cup play-offs after the draw was conducted on Wednesday. The other Kenyan club in the competition, Bandari will travel to Guinea for the first leg of their tie against Horoya SC as they bid make history by advancing to the group stages for the first time in the club's history.
