LONDON British lawmakers on Monday rejected an attempt by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to hold an early general election on December 12, as he sought to break the political deadlock over Brexit. A total of 299 MPs voted in support of his proposal, with 70 against, but he did not secure the backing of the two-thirds of the 650 MPs required by law to pass the motion.
