Police in Njoro, Nakuru County, are holding a 13-year-old boy for allegedly defiling a neighbour’s one and half years-old baby at Mau Narok area. According to neighbours, the child had been left under the care of the teenager when he defiled her on Friday. “The boy took advantage of the mother’s absence to commit the heinous act. He was caught on the act by passers-by, who rescued the child,” said a neighbour who sought anonymity. Police officers saved the teenager from lynching by an irate mob that was baying for his blood. The baby was rushed to the Nakuru Level Five Hospital for treatment.
