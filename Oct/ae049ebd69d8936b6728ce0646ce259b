Two weeks ago, flying Squad officers in Eldoret recovered 13 vehicles suspected to have been stolen. The vehicles were seized from the home of a businessman in Ndaptabwa, Mosoriot in Nandi County. Mr Ipara said that the vehicles were recovered following a tip off from the public. “Whoever is saying that police are impounding wrong vehicles is day dreaming, the vehicles we impounded two weeks ago are still in our custody pending court cases,” Mr Ipara told journalists.
