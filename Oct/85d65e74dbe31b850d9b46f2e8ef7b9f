Court has freed Sarah Wairimu Kamotho, who is accused of killing her husband Tob Cohen, on Sh2 million cash bail. She has been directed to alternatively, deposit Sh4 million bond with two sureties of Sh2 million each. Justice Stella Mutuku has said the prosecution has not provided compelling reasons to deny her bail. Justice Mutuku further directed her parents to file testimonials stating that they are willing to accommodate her after the court barred her from accessing her matrimonial home without permission. UPKEEP Ms Kamotho will also be required to file a report showing how she will support herself financially after the prosecution said they want to know the source of the funds. The prosecution has said it will appeal the bail ruling.
