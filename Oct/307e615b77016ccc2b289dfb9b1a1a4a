Deputy President William Ruto has cautioned Jubilee Party politicians against being swayed to abandon their development agenda. Speaking during a business-oriented fundraiser at Meru National Polytechnic on Friday, Dr Ruto said the country will thrive if governed by leaders motivated by growth, not propaganda. "I have come to Meru several times and I will keep coming until I streamline the issues affecting this country. As Jubilee leaders, we were elected on the promise of delivering development and all of us must do that. The rest have nothing much but to make noise," he said.

Mr Gachagua said the Deputy President stood "by them during the hard times and they ought to give back by supporting him in 2022 [elections]".
