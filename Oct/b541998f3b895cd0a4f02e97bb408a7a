Ten National Super League (NSL) matches are on the cards on Friday in different venues as the second tie enters its eighth round. Nairobi City Stars, top of the table with 19 points from seven matches, will take on lowly placed APS Bomet at Camp Toyoyo from 4:15pm in a match that will be preceded by a 2pm kick-off between FC Talanta and Nairobi Stima at the same venue. Currently funded by Jonathan Jackson Foundation, City Stars boost of former Gor Mahia midfielder Erick Ochieng, former AFC Leopards defender Salim Abdalla, Cornelius Mwangi and Kenya international defender Wesley Onguso. Earlier at the same venue, fans will be entertained by a morning encounter involving cash-strapped Mt kenya United and Ushuru FC from 11am. The tie is expected to be explosive with both teams seeking to climb up the table. Administration Police, who have two wins and four draws, will be away in Thika to face second-placed Bidco United from 1pm in a match, while sixth placed Vihiga United will be at home in Mumias to Kibera Black Stars from 2pm. Vihiga United coach Sammy Okoth said they are ready to fight back for a place in the KPL next season. “We are meeting an experienced side, but my boys are good as well. We did have good week in training and we have prepared well for the show as we look forward to a win at home,” he said. The former international striker, who is working alongside Nick Yakhama, urged fans to turn up in large numbers. Fallen giants Shabana will be away to Vihiga Bullets where they will be seeking to put aside their financial woes and grab the three points.
