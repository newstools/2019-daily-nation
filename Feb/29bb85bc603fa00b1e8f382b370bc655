Record Kenyan champions Gor Mahia host arch-rivals AFC Leopards in the much talked about "Mashemeji derby" at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Saturday afternoon. But while encounters of years gone by literally brought the country to a stand still and turned the venue into a cacophony of crackling energy as the green of K'Ogalo competed for air with the blue and white of Ingwe, the latter day fixtures seem like a pale shadow in the twilight of a fading moonlight. Gone are the years when the razzmatazz around this fixture would see fans from both teams jam local shopping centres to purchase replica shirts and advance tickets for the duel. Gone are the days busloads of both sets of fans travelled from their upcountry bases to watch live from the stadium terraces their beloved team fight for victory against the bitter enemy. The mood around this encounter – the first meeting this season between the two sides, with 30 titles in between them - is decidedly muted. Is the derby losing its allure or is this just an apparition that will go away and the colours of the two teams forcefully paint their presence in the beautiful game in Kenya? Nation Sport sought the views of former players, football fans and common mwananchi in Nairobi on what should certainly be “The” fixture of the season. And these is what they had to say: Boniface Ambani: Ex-AFC Leopards striker:   Daniel Owino: Marketing Consultant, Gor Mahia fan:   Shillah Ihaji: Beautician, AFC Leopards fan:   Reginald Asibwa: Ex-Ministry of Works and AFC Leopards defender:   Hellen Anyango: Hotelier and Gor Mahia fan:
