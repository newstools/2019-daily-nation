Champions Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) touched down five tries to silence Kabras Sugar 44-20 and end their unbeaten run in the 2018/19 Kenya Cup rugby league on Saturday at the Impala Sports Club. Dubbed the "duel of the season," the highly physical and tactical showdown lived up to its billing with Curtis Olagoâ€™s charges taking a 16-13 at the break before blowing away the sugar millers in the second half. Tries from prop Oscar Simiyu, scrum-half Michael Wanjala, inside centre Brian Omondi, outside centre Peter Kilonzo and substitute forward Brian Nyikuli handed Kabras Sugar their first defeat in 11 outings. The victory also catapulted KCB to the top of the table for the first time this season with 50 points as Kabras Sugar dropped one place to second with 49 points. It was a great victory for Olago, who was coming up against a Kabras Sugar side that had head coach Henley Du Plessis backed by former Kenya Simbas coach Jerome Paarwater. Nondescripts battled to edge out Blak Blad from Kenyatta University 10-7 the Jamhuri Park showground to stay third in the log after improving their tally to 37 points. SUMMARISED RESULTS KCB 44-20 Kabras Sugar; Impala 36-23 Homeboyz; Nondies 10-7 Blak Blad; Machine 15-36 Menengai Oilers; Nakuru 29-15 Mwamba
