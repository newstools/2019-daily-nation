Brian Magonya struck late to deny Nicholas Muyoti victory on his touchline debut as Kakamega Homeboyz were held 2-2 by visiting Sofapaka at Bukhungu stadium in Kakamega on Saturday. Umaru Kasumba put Sofapaka ahead in the 36th minute before Homeboyz second half substitute Maxwell Ravel equalised in the 63rd. Allan Wanga converted a penalty for Homeboyz to hand them the lead in the 75th but the celebration did not last long as Sofapaka drew level at the death through Magonya. Muyoti was pleased with a point against a formidable side like Sofapaka in his first match in charge. “This team (Homeboyz) has good players, they only require some fine tuning here and there to make things better," said Muyoti. Sofapaka tactician John Baraza rued missed chances especially in the first half. “We could have won the match had my forwards made use of the numerous scoring chances,” said Baraza. Sofapaka grabbed the lead on 36 minutes when Kasumba capitalised on a defensive mix-up to slot home. On resumption, the hosts found the leveller through Ravel. Wanga then set them ahead in the 75th minute after Soter Kayumba had handled in the box following high pressure from Homeboyz forwards Moses Mudavadi and Luke Namanda. There was a late twist though as the 2009 champions were rescued by Magonya who secured a point with only a minute left. Meanwhile at the Chemelil Sugar Complex, KCB rallied from a goal down to settle for a 1-1 draw with hosts Chemelil Sugar.   Mathare United scored two late goals to beat AFC Leopards.
