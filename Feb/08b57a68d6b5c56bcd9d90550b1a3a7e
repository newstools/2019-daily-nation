Various streets in the Nairobi Central Business District are currently lined in blue, white and green in readiness for the Mashemeji Derby that kicks off at 3pm at Kasarani. Fans of both Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards converged in the city early morning donning all manner of cultural attire and carrying other paraphernalia, and they made rounds singing traditional songs and taunting each other ahead of the big showdown. As has been the case for about three years now, Gor come out as overwhelming favourites, while Ingwe have everything to prove having failed to beat their rivals in the last five meetings.   The match will bring together Rwandan Andre Casa Mbungo against Cypriot Hassan Oktay in a clash of wits, and it will be the first time that both tacticians are getting a taste of the Kenyan derby excitement.   K’Ogalo are fourth with 19 points, nine ahead of 15th-placed Leopards.   Kenyan international Dennis Oliech grazed his knee in Friday’s training session and is doubtful for this match. VIP and terrace tickets will go for Sh500 and Sh200 respectively.     Dennis Oliech is doubtful after limping off training at Camp Toyoyo grounds.
