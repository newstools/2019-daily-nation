A heavy contingent of anti-riot police is on standby at Juja Police Station to avert a planned demonstration by Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology students. The Jkuat student’s union officials had on Thursday called for a peaceful demonstration to protest over the rising cases of student murders in Juja. “This is to inform all students that we will be having a peaceful demonstration in Juja following a series of killings, the most recent having been on February 7, 2019 at Seagull Restaurant," read the statement issued by JKUSA. The victim, a first year Development studies female student succumbed to stabbing injuries while being rushed to hospital. The deceased and her friends were walking near Seagull Restaurant when thugs, who demanded to be given money and mobile phones, attacked them. “She (victim) was stabbed after refusing to cooperate. She died due to excessive bleeding while being taken to hospital,” a student who sought anonymity told Nation.
