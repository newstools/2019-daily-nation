Muthaiga Golf Club’s Greg Snow returned an impressive score of two under-par 69 at Karen Country Club on Sunday to take an early lead in the final leg of the 2018/2019 Safari Tour golf series. Snow, recently crowned Safari Tour series champion, got off to a slow start, picking up a bogey on the par-four, third and recovered with back-to-back birdies on the fifth and sixth holes to turn to the back nine on 34. He was on course for a clean 34, after a birdie at the 12th, before dropping a shot at the home green. Snow was happy with his overall performance. “I’m pleased with my performance today. The course is in great shape, although quite challenging with the narrow greens. I’m working on keeping this form in the coming rounds,” he said. Great Rift Golf Resort’s Justus Madoya and amateur Daniel Nduva fired one under par each, to tie in second place. Madoya birdied the par-three second and par-five sixth, after dropping shots on the third and fourth in the first nine. He played a round of 35 in the back nine for the day’s under par 70. Nduva started off with a bogey at the first but quickly settled with four birdies in the first nine to return a law score of 32, the lowest nine in day one. Further bogeys at the 10th, 15th and 16th holes saw him return 38. The trio of David Opati, Simon Ngige and Anil Shah were on 71 each while 71, Mumias Golf Club’s Dismas Indiza posted three over 74, placing him tying 16th, one shot behind Windsor's Rizwan Charania. Meanwhile, Golf Park’s Joseph Karanja led his team to victory at the Pro-Am event at the same venue on Saturday, posting 39 points to combine with his amateur partners on 44 for a total of 83 points. His team beat that of Kopan Timbe who returned a score of 38, with Golf Park’s Tony Omuli finishing third.
