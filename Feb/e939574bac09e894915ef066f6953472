Tharaka-Nithi County Assembly speaker and clerk have been sued for contempt of court. The court head on Thursday that the county assembly clerk had allegedly instructed his secretary not to receive a court order that had stopped the impeachment motion against Deputy Speaker Susan Ngugi. Mr Jackson Murithi, a court process server, told the High Court in Chuka that he delivered the court order on February 12, 2019 at the county assembly offices in Chuka town. He said that assembly clerk’s secretary told him that she had been instructed not to sign the delivery note. TEXT MESSAGE Mr Murithi told the court that after insisting that she signs the delivery note, the secretary gave him her boss’ cell phone number which he called but was not picked. “After the clerk failed to pick my phone calls, I wrote him a text message explaining that I had delivered a court order at his office,” Mr Murithi told the court. He said that he had handed over the document to the right office, considering that he had delivered a notice of motion to the same office on February 8, 2019. IMPEACHED Ms Ngugi, who is also the Marimanti ward representative, was impeached on February 12. Her lawyer asked the court to consider his client’s reinstatement but Judge Robert Limo said that the matter could only be considered after the contempt case is heard to completion. The judge directed that Ms Ngugi and the respondent’s counsel submit written submissions within two days for further orders. The case will be mentioned on February 26.   The ouster was executed despite a court order suspending it untill February 15.
