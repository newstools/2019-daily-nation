Addis Ababa and other cities across Ethiopia are observing the country's third Car Free Day. With none of the usual traffic clogging the capital, Sunday football devotees took to the streets. The monthly event is promoted by local NGOs and the Ethiopian government and is designed to promote a healthy lifestyle and fight air pollution. The measure was implemented by the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was came to office last April after his predecessor resigned. The event also allowed skateboarders to show off their skills.              CBD will be closed to vehicles and traders allowed to sell their wares.
