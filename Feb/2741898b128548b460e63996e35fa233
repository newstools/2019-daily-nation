A man has been charged with putting his daughter in a travelling bag then attempting to sneak her out of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) due to the inability to pay a Sh56,937 bill. Boniface Murage Wangechi, 222, was arrested at the lift lobby by two Lavington Security guards after resorting to this action in order to take his one and half-year-old daughter home. The child was admitted on January 26 and discharged on February 11. Before Milimani Resident Magistrate Caroline Muthoni Nzibe on Monday, Mr Murage admitted that he attempted to commit a felony. DETENTION FEAR When the charge was read to him, Ms Nzibe asked Mr Murage whether he attempted to sneak his daughter out of the hospital. He responded, “It is true. Yes, I attempted to go away with my daughter.” He added, “I feared that my daughter and my beloved wife would be detained at KNH for long since I could not raise the bill." The man further told the trial magistrate, “After my arrest by guards David Kileki and Lewis Chesubet, my daughter and wife were returned to the hospital where they are now being detained.” ASSISTANCE Mr Murage said he did not know for how long his family would remain at KNH "as they are being guarded round-the-clock since I cannot raise that amount”. He appealed for assistance from good Samaritans and well-wishers saying, “From February 11 when my daughter was discharged, I have made fruitless efforts to raise the outstanding bill." The court granted the prosecution's request to detain Mr Murage until Tuesday when exhibits will be produced. The court will sentence Mr Murage on Tuesday.   Money owed by patients who left without paying for treatment.
