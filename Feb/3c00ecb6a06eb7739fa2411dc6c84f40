Hi Brenda, I am a very frustrated woman. My partner never seems to tell me what’s on his mind, even when I ask. It’s like he expects me to read his mind or guess what he wants. When I say we should discuss some things, as we live together, he brushes me off. Sometimes he agrees to discuss and tells me to say what I think. When I do speak, he says I have too much expectation. But he won’t give me a reason or give me his view of the discussion even when I ask him too. Help!  Hi, This sounds complicated. Why does your husband think you're psychic? How long have you been married? But communication is essential, no matter how long you've been married. How is the house running without speech? How do you find out what he wants for dinner if he doesn't say? Or whether he's allergic to something in the food that will then make him choke and die? You might want to consider couple's therapy at this point, so that you express what is going on with you – seeing as he clearly isn't interested in what you have to say when you say it. Of course you have expectation – because he is giving you nothing. The point of a relationship is to relate, no? Alternately, do your own thing until he complains, then you can start the conversation again because clearly that's what he expects you to do... *** *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I am afraid of hurting her or worse, losing her and the three children we have together.
