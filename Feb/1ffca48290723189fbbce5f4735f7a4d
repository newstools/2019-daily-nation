A church leader was on Wednesday found hanging from a tree in Gachigi village, Kirinyaga County. Police suspect the 60-year-old lay leader of the Anglican Church of Kenya killed himself. The leader was spotted by residents early morning who were on their way to their farms. The incident was reported to police who arrived shortly and took the body to the mortuary. As news spread that the church leader had been found dead, people gathered at his home to mourn his death. The mourners said they were shocked by the sudden death of the church leader whom they described as humorous and generous. Gachigi Archdeacon Emily Wanja described the victim as a God-fearing man and wondered why he had decided to take his own life. She called on the police to do a thorough investigation and reveal the truth of the matter. Gachigi sub-locational assistant chief Justin Rukenya said he was in his office when he was informed of the incident. "I immediately went to the scene only to find the man whom we know very well hanging from a tree," he said.
