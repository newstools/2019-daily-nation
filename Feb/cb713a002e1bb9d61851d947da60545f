A middle aged woman escaped death narrowly after police saved her from an irate mob that was baying for her blood. The mob invaded Ms Mwikali Kilonzi’s shop in Kiomo, Kitui County on Tuesday and beat her up for allegedly taking part in the murder of her 21-year-old nephew, last year. The residents are said to have taken the law into their hands, after the police took too long to arrest Ms Mwikali and her brother Mr Mutua Mbindyo, the main suspects. The two are being held at Mwingi Police Station. ARREST SUSPECTS Area residents alleged that Mr Mbindyo had threatened to kill his son Mutuku Mbindyo for leaking information that he had an affair with his daughter-in-law. Mr Daniel Muoti, a human rights activist in Mwingi told Nation.co.ke that during a public baraza on Monday, the residents had asked the police to arrest key suspects in Mr Mutuku’s murder. Ms Mwikali’s husband John Kilonzi said he was not aware that his wife had a hand in Mr Mutuku’s death. “I cannot imagine my wife and her brother colluded to kill his son, I call upon the police to conduct thorough investigations. If my wife was involved in any way, she should face the law,” said Mr Kilonzi.
