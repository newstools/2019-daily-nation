Two people were on Wednesday charged at a Nakuru court for defiling a Form Two student. Appearing before Resident Magistrate Eunice Kelly, Jairus Ngaira 27, and Peter Ochieng’ 26, were charged with defiling the minor at Kivumbini Estate, Nakuru, on diverse dates between January 21 and February 2. According to the prosecution, one of the suspects lured the girl, who was out on an errand, into his vehicle before driving off to his house in Kivumbini. Police report indicates that the suspects locked the minor in the house where they defiled her in turns for 10 days. CRITICAL CONDITION The suspects were arrested after the girl’s aunt made a report at Kaptembwo Police Station that her niece was missing. The minor, who was reportedly found in critical condition, was rescued from the suspect’s house. The accused persons, however, denied the charges and were released on a Sh200,000 cash bail.
