Kenya international Clifton Miheso says he is excited by another opportunity to play professionally in Europe. The left-footed winger on Thursday became only the second Kenyan footballer in recent times to play in Portugal, following in the footsteps of former Kenyan Premier League top scorer Francis Ouma. The 25-year signed for third-tier side Clube Olimpico do Montijo on a one-year long deal on transfer deadline day and also believes this opportunity will offer him a chance to convince Harambee Stars coach Sebastian Migne to select him for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations set for Egypt in June. "It is a wonderful opportunity to play in Europe again," said Miheso, who enjoyed a spell at top Finland side Vaasan Palloseura between 2013 and 2015. "The aim is for me to settle, of course learn the language and help my team to improve even as I learn. If I play well here, then I know I stand a chance of playing in Egypt." Miheso moves to Portugal from top Zambian club Buildcon and has also enjoyed separate stints at South Africa with Golden Arrows and Kenya's AFC Leopards.
