When President Uhuru Kenyatta met the Sports, Arts and Social Development Fund oversight board at State House, Nairobi, on Friday, he urged the newly formed team to utilise resources at its disposal to restore the country’s sporting glory, promote the arts and preserve the rich national heritage. The President said there is a need to revive sports and the arts by motivating young people through adequate resourcing. There has been debate on the government’s commitment to development of local sports. The country now needs to see results by way of financing development of sports and recreation facilities. For instance, stadiums across the country that are in a pathetic state. Apart from Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, which is in a somewhat good state, the rest of the arenas are in poor state — including Nyayo National Stadium, Kipchoge Keino in Eldoret and Ruring’u in Nyeri. Other county stadiums — such as Nairobi City Stadium and Mombasa Stadium — are in a deplorable state. The country failed to host the African Nations Championship (Chan) continental football tournament last year due to the poor state of the stadiums. National teams have previously struggled to raise funds to honour international assignments with football, volleyball and rugby the most affected disciplines. The board will manage some of the proceeds from the 15 percent that is taxed on betting, lotteries and gaming companies, where the Sports ministry will have 55 percent under its control, with 35 percent meant for sports. It should, therefore, be in a position to oversee the building of strong national sports teams through provision of adequate funding as well as branding and provision of the necessary supplies.
