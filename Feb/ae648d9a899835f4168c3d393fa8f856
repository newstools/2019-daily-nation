A Form Two student accused of killing a secondary school teacher in Nakuru will remain in custody for one more week. The Tumaini Secondary School, who appeared in court on Monday, failed to plead to the charges for the second time since the judge was away. The suspect has been charged with killing Mr Peter Mogusu Omare, a Physics and Computer Studies teacher at Hopewell Secondary School in Barut, Nakuru County on January 24 while in the company of others not before court. The case, which was set for mention on Tuesday, has been set for February 20. CONTINUED DETENTION High Court Judge Janet Mulwa had on January 28 directed that the suspect be taken to Nakuru Level Five Hospital for mental tests. His lawyer Peter Bore complained that his clientâ€™s right to freedom was being violated by his continued detention without being formally charged. The suspect has been in custody since January 24. Mr Omare died after he was attacked and hit by blunt object on the head. The teacher had earlier confiscated a mobile phone from a student.
