Matatus picking up and dropping off passengers at non-gazetted locations in Nairobi's city centre will be impounded starting Monday. The Nairobi County government has issued a notice to matatu operators to ensure that their vehicles stop using illegal pick-up and drop-off points. Nairobi County Director of Parking Services Tom Tinega said the matatus have created many illegal bus stops in the Central Business District (CBD). This, according to Mr Tinega, has brought about chaos and huge traffic jams leading to losses in profits and man hours. "This is to inform that only gazetted drop-off points would be allowed and all non-gazetted drop-off points have been suspended with immediate effect," said Mr Tinega. He said some of the illegal bus stops are on Tom Mboya and Moi Avenues.   Nairobi County government wants to relocate Public Service Vehicles outside the city centre.
