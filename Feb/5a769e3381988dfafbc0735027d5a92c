Nominated Nairobi County ward representatives are set to get new offices, personal assistants and improved perks, the assembly Majority Leader Abdi Guyo has said. Mr Guyo said the 39 nominated members will enjoy the new perks in the next financial year. In the Nairobi County’s Annual Development Plan (CADP) for the year 2019/2020, Sh400 million was set aside for the construction of new offices for only elected members without any mention of the nominated colleagues. “Even the nominated members need equal treatment with their elected colleagues for them to perform their oversight, legislative and representative roles. They need personal assistants to help with research as well as new offices to operate from just like their elected counterparts,” said Mr Guyo. Matopeni MCA’s announcement came after South B ward representative Chege Waithera said her nominated colleagues’ performance has been negatively affected by lack of offices. “This is against a Salaries and Remuneration Commission circular on the same so I am urging the leadership to ensure they have permanent structures,” said Ms Waithera, who is the assembly’s Majority Chief Whip. Meanwhile, the construction of office blocks for elected reps is set to begin this year with the county government expected to spend aSh100 million on furniture and computers. The new offices will be located at the parking space between Taifa Road and City Hall Way. The CADP report indicates that only 53 wards out of 85 in the city have offices, which are rented spaces. The offices in the other 32 wards are in a poor state.
