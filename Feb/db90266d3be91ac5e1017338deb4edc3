The Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Twenty20 Super Division champions, Kanbis, Sunday enhanced their chances of retaining their trophy when they beat Swamibapa by 38 runs at Nairobi Gymkhana to secure a place in the final. Kanbis’ evergreen batsman, Ramesh Mepani, knocked an unbeaten half a century, 64 that came off 52 deliveries with two boundaries and six sixes. Mepani was Kanbis’ highest runs getter. Batting first, Kanbis set a target of 164 for the loss of five wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Rakep Patel (32 not out off 28 balls with two boundaries, Ankit Hirani (23 off 28 balls with two boundaries), Dhiren Gondaris (22 off 14 balls with three boundaries) and Rajesh Bhudiya (11 off seven balls with a boundary and a six) were Kanbis’ batsmen who posted double digit figures on the scoreboard. Swamibapa’s wickets were shared between Indravadan Varsani (2/19) and Jadavji Bhimji (1/16). There was one run out. In reply, Swamibapa managed to score 125 with one wicket in hand by the time they completed their overs. Morris Ouma (38 off 24 balls with three boundaries and same number of sixes) top scored for Swamibapa. H. Kerai (23 off 28 balls with a six), Irfan Karim (19 off 31 Bals with a boundary) and James Ngoche (12 off seven balls and a six) were Swamibapa’s batsmen who scored meaningful runs for their side. Hiren Kabaria was Swamibapa’s main destroyer taking four wickets for 18. Rajesh (1/20), Jayant Mepani (1/13) and Gautam Bhudia (1/23) were the other wicket takers. Even though Swamibapa were beaten by Kanbis, they still have a chance of vying for a place in the final. They will fight it out for that final slot with Nairobi Gymkhana this Saturday. The final is set for Sunday at a venue to be announced later. Nairobi Gymkhana (181 for 5 in 20 overs) yesterday booked themselves a date with Swamibapa when they beat Ngara Sports Club (151 4 in 20 overs) by 30 runs at Sikh Union ground. Rushab Patel was Gymkhana’s highest scorer with half a century, 75 that came off 44 balls with six boundaries and five sixes.
