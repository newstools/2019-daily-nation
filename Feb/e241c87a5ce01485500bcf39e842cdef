Reports that three injured national 15s rugby team players stayed for three months without getting medical attention despite having represented Kenya at the 2019 World Cup qualifying tournament is disturbing. Dalmas Chituyi and Colman Were finally underwent knee surgeries at Kijabe Hospital this week while Martin Owillah is set for a similar procedure next week after they got injured during the repechage tournament in France last November. The predicament of these players cuts across all sporting disciplines in the country where players get injured while doing duty for the country but are left without treatment or are forced to use their own means to get treated. Some have been forced to quit sports after sustaining injuries that are treatable. It really does not make sense that the rugby players can stay for almost three months awaiting specialists, besides the renewal of their insurance cover. This clearly shows lack of planning from Kenya Rugby Union. There is need for seriousness by sporting federations as far as player welfare is concerned. The injured players will now miss out the whole rugby season and what makes it worse is that some won’t play for their respective clubs hence missing out on much needed allowances and benefits. How will these players be compensated especially if they don’t have any other means of survival or were temporary engaged with these clubs? It’s a high time that the government should through Sports Fund set aside money for insurance or a fund to cater for injured national teams players. More so, besides just treatment, the government and sports federations should also explore ways of compensating players, who sustain career-ending injuries while representing the country.
