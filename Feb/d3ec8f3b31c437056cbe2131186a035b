Tokyo Marathon planned for Sunday in Japan is the youngest event in the World Marathon Majors (WMM), which has a jackpot of Sh100 million that is shared between the men and women’s winner at the end of the season. Tokyo Marathon that turns 13 years this year, was staged as one of the races in the WMM in 2013, making it the sixth race after Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, and New York. The first Tokyo Marathon was held on February 18, 2007, with Kenya’s Daniel Njenga launching the country’s dominance in the race with victory in 2:09:45, as home athlete Hitomi Niiya claimed victory in the women’s race in 2:31:02. However, before the race gained a full International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Gold Label marathon status in 2007, Tokyo Marathon actually consisted of two marathons; the Tokyo International Marathon, which took place on even years, and Tokyo/New York Friendship International Marathon which took place on odd years.     In the inaugural year, 1981, both marathons took place. However, because it was not possible to support two marathons a month apart in the same city, from 1982, the alternating format went into effect. The 2007 Tokyo Marathon was also a representative selection race of the 2007 World Championships in Osaka. The total number of participants was set at 30,000. Of that, 25,000 people signed up for the marathon and 5,000 signed up for the 10km run. DICKSON CHUMBA Kenyan men have dominated to win eight of the 12 editions, with their main rivals Ethiopia winning three in the marathon that is sponsored by Tokyo Metro. Ethiopians have dominated the women’s race, winning five events, hosts Japan have won thrice, while Kenya has chalked two wins. Kenya’s Dickson Chumba is the only man to have won the title twice. Chumba became the first man to run under 2 hours and six minutes with a course record victory time of 2:05:42.   This was only the second time a runner ran below 2h06 in Japan after Tsegaye Kebede in Fukuoka Marathon on December 6, 2009. His runner-up, Tadese Tola did also run below 2:06 in a time of 2:05:57. Chumba would reclaim the title last year when he triumphed in 2:05:30, the second fastest time on the course after fellow countryman’s Wilson Kipsang’s course record time of 2:03:58 in 2017. The trailblazing Wilson Kipsang shattered Chumba’s previous course record time by a massive two minutes and 44 seconds with his time of 2:03:57, being the fastest time on the Asia soil and 11th all-time best.   Viktor Röthlin from Switzerland is the only European to have won the marathon, the second edition in 2010 in 2:07:23, with Salim Kipsang becoming the second Kenyan to claim victory in 2011 in 2:10:27. Masakazu Fujiwara is so far the only Japanese to have won the race during the fourth edition in 2010 in 2:12:19, which is the slowest time in the race’s history. NOT RAINY Hailu Mekonnen won the race for Ethiopia for the first time in 2011 in 2:07:35, which made him the first athlete to run under 2 hours and 08 minutes. The 2011 Tokyo Marathon was the first race in which the weather was not rainy. The other Ethiopians to win the race were Endeshaw Negesse in 2015 in 2:06:00 and Feyisa Lilesa in 2016 in 2:06:56.   Tokyo Marathon has been a springboard to some athletes who have proceeded to win major accolades. For instance, after his victory in 2016, Lelisa went on to win silver at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, losing the battle to Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge. Dennis Kimetto, who was the fourth Kenyan to win in Tokyo in 2013 in 2:06:50, went on to smash the marathon World Record during the Berlin Marathon the same year, setting new times of 2:02:57 to become the first man to run under 2 hours 03 minutes. Wilson Kipsang held the previous record of 2:03:23 set in 2013 Berlin. Birhane Dibaba from Ethiopia is the only woman to have won the title twice in 2:23:15 in 2015 and last year in 2:19:51.   The 2015 World marathon silver medallist Helah Kiprop was the first Kenyan to win the women’s race in 2016 in a course record time of 2:21:27. Kiprop was the first woman to deep under 2hours and 22 minutes, breaking Ethiopia’s Tirfi Tsegaye’s course record time of 2:22:23 from 2014. Kenya’s Sarah Chepchirchir, who is currently suspended for doping violation, holds the course record time of 2:19:47 from victory in 2017, while the lowest winning time is by German Claudia Dreher of 2:35:35 from 2008.   This year’s Tokyo Marathon planned for Sunday has registered the highest number of participants with 331,211 applicants. Out of those, 330,271 were for the full marathon and 940 were for the 10km race. When registrations closed for the 2015 Tokyo Marathon, 308,810 people had applied for the full marathon and 1,014 for the 10km race. This gave a total number of 309,824 applicants and an oversubscription rate of 11.3 for the marathon.
