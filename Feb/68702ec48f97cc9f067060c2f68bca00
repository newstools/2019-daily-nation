Hosts Bandari claimed a deserved a 2-0 win over Vihiga United in a SportPesa Premier League match at the Mbaraki Stadium, Mombasa on Tuesday. Goals either side of half time from David Kingatua and Yema Mwana handed the dockers the three points against a poor Vihiga United. The win saw the dockers return to the second position with 25 points, overtaking champions Gor Mahia who have travelled to Angola for continental assignment. After a series of missed chances, danger man Wycliffe Ochomo making a rare start was felled 35 yards outside the box and Kingatua calmly slotted the ball at the far corner of the net with goalkeeper Geofrey Oputi well beaten for a 1-0 halftime score. Vihiga came to the second half strongly forcing Bandari goalkeeper Farouk Shikalo to saves with Steve Wakanya and Rashid Kyambadde on fire, while stylish Alex Imbusia controlled the midfield. It was however, Bandari, who scored against the run of play with Mwama tapping in a William Wadri cross off a Darius Msagha free kick.
