Handicap 15 golfer Ben Nyamongo beat a field of 151 players at the par 72 Machakos Golf Club course, to claim the 2019 Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) corporate golf tournament at the weekend. In a day dominated by the middle and high handicap golfers, Nyamongo whose last major victory was in the Konza City Golf Day last July, managed to collect 12 pars in his round which also included three double bogeys, and six single bogeys, for an impressive 39 points. “I have been working so hard over the past few months to try and improve my game, and I am so happy that everything worked well for me today’’ said the big hitter Nyamongo who finished in 93rd place during last year’s KPA event. It was, however, a close encounter between him and handicap 11 Victor Mutwii who carded 38 points to claim the men’s first prize though after beating Edward Tenga on countback. Dominic Kikuyu, who was among the tournament favourites, posted 37 points to finish third, after beating veteran golfer Charles Mulela on countback. In the ladies section, Jane Kiiti took the first prize with a score of 37 points, followed by Stella Nzioki on 35 points. In the staff category, long hitting Charles Odoo combined 20 and 15 points to claim the first prize, with Terry Odoo finishing second on 34 points. Taking the third prize was Yobesh Oyaro on 31 and J. Obonyo was fourth with 27 points, one better than Fiona Mbandi who clinched the fifth prize. Meanwhile, Muthaiga Golf Club’s Paul Muigai also playing off handicap 15, recovered from a string of bogeys and a scratch at the 18th hole, to post an impressive 39 points. He won by two points from L. Kinyori while finishing in third place was Muthaiga Golf Club’s Philip Ochola on 36 points, just a point better than handicap one Robinson Owiti of Vet Lab Sports Club who played two under par back nine to finish on two over par 35. “The first nine messed me. You have to know where to place your ball particularly on the approach shots’’ said Owiti, one of the leading amateur golfers in the country.
