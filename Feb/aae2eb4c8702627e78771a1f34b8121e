Migori County government will demolish structures built on Migori-Isibania highway in an attempt to decongest the town. In a notice released on Friday, traders have been given up to February 4 to clear out. "To decongest Migori Town and create more space for motorists and pedestrians on Migori-Isibania highway, the county government will on Monday demolish all structures illegally erected on the road reserves," the notice reads. But traders have opposed the directive saying they were not informed in time. They also argue that sources of income will be interrupted. "We do not know where the county government would like us to go. Why didn't they give us at least one month notice to enable us plan our affairs?" Mr Martin Onyango said. They now ask Governor Okoth Obado to give them an alternative location. "We call upon the government to relocate us to a better place so as to continue earning our livelihoods," Ms Mary Owino said. County officer Moses Kivanda said most traders have encroached the road reserve along the highway leading to traffic snarl-ups and road accidents.
