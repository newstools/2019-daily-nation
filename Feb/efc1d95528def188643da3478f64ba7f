Kenya’s Gor Mahia face Zamalek, the Egyptians, in the first leg of their Group D match of the Confederation of African Football Cup at the Moi International Sports Centre on Sunday. The duel has been the talk of town since the draw was done. Pairing of the two teams brings back memories of the 1998 Caf Confederation Cup, where Gor won the first leg 1-0 in Nairobi but ended up losing 4-0 in Cairo. We take this opportunity to wish Gor the best of luck and implore fans to turn up in large numbers to cheer the team to victory. Gor will later face NA Hussein Dey of Algeria and Angola’s Petro de Luanda in the contest that will be featured on home and away basis with the two top teams proceeding to the knockout stage. It is critical for Gor to take the match seriously knowing that every match and goal counts. The players must perform and get the results; they are carrying the dreams of a nation. It can be recalled that last year, Gor missed out of the big pay at Champions League on the away goal rule even after they drew 3-3 with Lobi Stars of Nigeria. Although Gor had won 3-1 in Nairobi in the first leg, it lost 2-0 in the return leg match in Enugu to drop out of the Confederation Cup. With that, K'ogalo missed out on a Sh54 million purse that the cash-strapped club badly needed. Last year, Gor also got relegated to the Confederation Cup and failed to reach the knockout stage after they blundered in their last matches. For instance, they drew 1-1 with Rayon Sport away in Rwanda only to lose to them 2-1 in Nairobi, in a match they had been tipped to win rather easily. Gor has a chance to deliver and it must do it tomorrow. We call on fans to turn out, support the team and most importantly, behave decently. Act of hooliganism could earn the team a ban from subsequent matches or hefty fines from Caf.
