The 14 boys who will represent Kenya in the International Cricket Council Africa World Cup qualifiers, will be selected on Sunday. The qualifiers are set for Windhoek, Namibia from March 17-25. Thirty nine lads from Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru took part in a two day trials in Nairobi over the weekend, with the head coach Jimmy Kamande trimming the lot to 22. Nairobi had the bulk of boys in the squad with 14 making the cut followed by Mombasa with six and Nakuru with two. Kamande on Monday said that the shortlisted boys will train at their respective clubs in the evenings after school. “We will give our best even though we have a very short time to work with the boys before the names of the 14 players who will compete in the qualifiers are submitted to ICC by February 15.” Former national team coach Thomas Odoyo, who is now based in Mombasa says that the national trials will not be necessary if the country had proper cricket structures. “The talented boys will be spotted early in programmes covering different age groups: under-13, under-15, and under-17.” The Nakuru based Cricket Kenya’s elite coach, Peter Ongondo is confident that the class of 2019 is better than that of 2017 which qualified for the Junior World Cup in New Zealand. In Namibia, Kenya will fight it out with Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and hosts Namibia for the sole slot reserved for the non-Test playing countries on the continent. The 2020 World Cup will take place South Africa in January and February. South Africa and Zimbabwe, the two Test playing countries in Africa have automatic qualification to the global showpiece.
