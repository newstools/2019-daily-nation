Hi Brenda I enjoy reading your column, thank you for the good work. I am a 28-year-old small scale entrepreneur who is searching for a wife. My problem is, I have never been able to sustain a solid relationship with women. The longest I have been in a relationship is two months. According to the women I meet, I am a poor communicator. I have also been accused of hating women because of my constant criticism of certain behaviours of some women. I dislike women who beg me for money or expect me to call them every day. Although I feel like the world is short of good women, I need to find the woman of my dreams and marry her because I am not getting any younger. Please advise.  Hi, It does sound like you want a robot. Maybe you should consider moving to China or places that make robot women who don't talk too much and don't mind criticism. Because short of that, I'm not sure how you're going to find a living, breathing, willing partner. Here's the thing. If you want a woman, find out what she likes, and do it. It's as simple as that. When you like someone you figure out how to communicate that like in a way that THEY understand - not a way that YOU understand. If she likes flowers, get her flowers, and often. Not because you like them, but because she does. Girls just want to have fun and be loved in a way they understand. Figure that part out. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
