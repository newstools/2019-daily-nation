Kenyan champions Gor Mahia will face Zamalek of Egypt in the opening group game of the Caf Confederation Cup at Kasarani stadium on Sunday without SportPesa-branded kits. This is after Confederation of African Football (Caf) asked Gor to submit a different name of a sponsor that does not contradict the tournament sponsors namely Total, QNET and 1XBET. “Kindly be informed that your club is not authorized to put the mentioned publicity during the matches of the TOTAL Caf Confederation Cup 2019 as it contradicts with the competition sponsor, 1XBET,” read a letter addressed to Gor Mahia from Caf. “In case your club did not submit a different sponsor then they will be playing the matches of the Confederation Cup 2019 without any publicity on the jerseys of the players,” the statement further read. Gor Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lordvick Aduda has said they will respect the laid rules and regulations. “These games belong to Caf so we must abide by their rules,” noted Aduda. “Even Simba played without their shirt sponsor (SportPesa) against Al Ahly same to Orlando Pirates,” he added. This is the first time Gor will be playing continental matches without the name of their shirt sponsor on their kit having donned SportPesa-branded jerseys in last season’s edition.
