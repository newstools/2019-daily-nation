The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) director for roads safety Njeri Waithaka is set to quit her job, barely three weeks after police raided the agency’s offices, arresting senior staff members alleged to have facilitated registration of the DusitD2 terror attack vehicle. Ms Waithaka, who took over from Mr Mathew Munyao whose contract was terminated in January 2016, handed in her resignation letter to the board a couple of days ago, according to a confidential source. In the letter, Ms Waithaka cited “personal reasons” for not be seeking the extension of her term. Speaking to Business Daily by phone Monday, NTSA director-general Francis Meja confirmed that Ms Waithaka had quit the agency but declined to give details. “I’m aware of Ms Waithaka’s case. She has handed in her resignation letter,” said Mr Meja. “As to when exactly she is expected to leave the agency plus other restructuring plans we may have are private information within our organisation I may not be able to disclose to you at the moment,” he said. Her resignation comes weeks after the Anti-Terror Police Unit (ATPU) raided NTSA’s offices, arresting scores of the agency’s employees, including senior managers working in the licensing, information technology, inspection and the registration of motor vehicles departments, in a probe over the registration of the vehicle which was used by terrorists during the 14 Riverside Drive attack. ATPU officers stormed the premises in Upper Hill on January 30, sealing off the building and disrupting crucial services.   Services at the NTSA were Wednesday paralysed as police arrested senior staff members alleged to have facilitated registration of the DusitD2 terror attack vehicle.
