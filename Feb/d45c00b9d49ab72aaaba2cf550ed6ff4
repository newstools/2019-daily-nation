A police officer in Murang'a County has been charged with defilement. Mr Michael Mwandi, a constable based at Gituamba police station in Gatanga, is accused of defiling a 13-year old after luring her with phonographic videos. He is detained at Murang’a GK prison after pleading not guilty. His bail ruling is set for Tuesday next week. The victim's father said his daughter confessed that the officer has defiled her seven times and threatened to kill her if she tells anyone. "My child agreed to share the information with us, saying how she was told never to disclose the matter to anyone on account that he could kill her," her father, a police officer and colleague to the accused, said. "I welcomed him and showed him how we operate even without caring that he was my junior. I wonder why he turned against me and destroyed the life of my child; it’s very unfair," he said. County Police Commander Josephat Kinyua confirmed the matter, saying they want to ensure the minor gets justice. "We have arrested the officer and handed him to the court so that the truth is established," he said. The received treatment at Thika Level Five Hospital.
