Top media houses have criticised Kenya Audience Research Foundation (KARF) over unreliable and inaccurate TV and radio ratings released to corporates and media agencies in the country. In a joint statement, Nation Media Group, Radio Africa Group, Standard Group, Capital Group Limited and Kenya Broadcasting Corporation called for the disbandment of the firm for failing redress long running concerns and the failure to put out credible research data They noted that the Media Owners Association's representative on the KARF oversight board has independently raised concern directly with KARF as well the executives of various media houses including the CEOs, but the firm continues to release patently unreliable and in some cases clearly falsified media data. The media houses requested KARF to withdraw from circulation last year results and cease any further publication of the data. “We further request that KARF as currently constituted, be immediately disbanded and an all-inclusive process of establishing a more reliable and accurate research process and function be commenced immediately,” the media houses said.
