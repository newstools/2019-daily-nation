Police were Thursday allowed to hold a man suspected to have been in constant communication with the main attacker at DusitD2 complex Hotel Ali Salim Gichunge, for 30 days. Prosecution counsel Harrison Kiarie told court that Benson Maina Mwangi was an associate of Mr Gichunge and is believed to have facilitated the procurement of a third-party cover for the motor vehicle that was used to ferry some of the attackers to the hotel on January 15. Other than the Toyota Ractis registration number KCN 340E, Mr Mwangi is alleged to have facilitated Mr Gichunge in procuring a cover for another vehicle registration number KCF 872R. The second vehicle was recovered at the home of Mr Gichunge in Mucatha. The investigating officer said the insurance covers were registered under his name as well as another suspect, Mr Stephen Maina, who is yet to be arrested. It is alleged that Mr Mwangi was in constant communication with Mr Gichunge, using different mobile phone numbers. He said they needed to investigate his role in the attack. The court allowed the prosecution's application and ordered the suspect be held in police station within Nairobi County for a period of 30 days. The matter will be mentioned on March 8.   Thanks to collusion by government officials, the vehicles then get counterfeit logbooks.
