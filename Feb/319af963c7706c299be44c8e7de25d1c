At least 300 people displaced following terror attacks in Lamu are still camping at Katsaka Kairu three years after they were uprooted from their homes. The displaced are mostly from Maleli, Jima, Kakathe, Nyongoro and Taa villages. Despite being assured of their security, many of them are still reluctant to return to their homes. In October 2017, the national government ordered the more than 2,000 IDPs to disperse and go back to their homes, saying their security is guaranteed. However, a spot check by the Nation Friday showed that a section of the IDPs have not heeded the directive. The government has since cut off any aid to the IDPs who have now been left to fend for themselves. Mr Kahindi Charo, a resident, said they don’t believe their villages are as safe as the security forces have been telling them. “We feel safer at the camp. We will only go back if the government compensates us and assures us of our security,” said Mr Kahindi. Mr William Mwangi said many of them lost their property. “The crops on our farms were destroyed. Our homes were looted while others were torched. The government must compensate us or else we won’t leave,” said Mr Mwangi. The IDPs are now appealing to the national and county governments to consider giving them alternative land at Katsaka Kairu.   Suspected Al-Shabaab militants invade two villages and execute the four people.
