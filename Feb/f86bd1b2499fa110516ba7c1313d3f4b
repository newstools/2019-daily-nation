A Thika-based alcohol manufacturing plant, African spirits, has been found in possession of ethanol of questionable quality and suspected fake Kenya Revenue Authority stamps following a raid conducted by officers from the Flying Squad, KRA and the DCI. African Spirits are the producers of Bluemoon vodka, Legend brandy, Glenrock whiskey, Furaha gin, and Furaha Vodka, among others drinks. Tens of tanks of ethanol were found stored in a container while other tanks were packed in trucks loaded with maize and oats at the plant. The plant is suspected to have been mixing its products manually and packing them without subjecting them to the required safety checks. The product is suspected to have gained entry through the Namanga border from Tanzania. Speaking at the scene, Flying Squad's country head Musa Yego said the company was producing substandard spirit and brews not fit for human consumption. "Some of the stamps on the drinks have failed KRA tests," said Mr Yego. Three suspects were arrested in the raid that begun Wednesday night running into Friday. KRA deputy commissioner Ann Irungu said the operation was part of the government's efforts to stop the sale of illicit brews in the country. She urged alcohol lovers to be cautious with the drinks they take by downloading the Soma Label app for use in verifying if their drinks conform to the required standards.
