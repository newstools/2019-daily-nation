An 11-year old herdsboy has been hospitalised with serious burns being scalded with hot water for allegedly stealing maize flour in Kargi, Marsabit County. Halkano Sembenu was punished by a villager who tied his hands with a rope and then immersed them in a pan of boiling water on Tuesday. The boy, whose hands had serious blisters, was left unattended outside a manyatta, for two days. The victim was grazing the family's sheep and goats when he wandered into a makeshift manyatta where he found some maize flour which he used to prepare ugali. No sooner had started eating his meal, than the manyatta owner, who sought to know why he had stolen his flour, arrived. HANGED The 40- year- old man then took a rope, tied Sembenu's hands and neck before boiling water in which he dipped the boy's hands. He also used a hot metal rod to scald the boy’s legs and back. The herdsboy was found lying unconscious under a shrub before being rushed to hospital. On Thursday, medics at Consolata Mission Hospital, Nkubu, in Meru County said the boy’s hands could be amputated. AMPUTATED “The burns are not doing well and there is a plan to amputate the right hand from above the elbow and the left one along the fingers,” said Ms Julia Muthomi, the institution’s director of nursing. According to Mr Peter Lepati, the victim's relative, the incident was reported at Kargi police post. He said the suspect was arrested by home guards but was later released after his friends invaded the police post. “We are seeking justice for the boy, the culprit should be arrested,” said Mr Lepati.
