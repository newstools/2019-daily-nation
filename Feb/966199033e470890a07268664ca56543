The Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) will build a new campus in the county following an agreement between Tharaka constituency office and the institution. The college will be built on a 100-acre parcel of land in Marimanti town. KMTC Board chairman Philip Kaloki said the first enrollment is expected in March 2020. Speaking in Marimanti on Friday, Prof Kaloki said the recruitment desk will be set up at Tharaka Sub-County Hospital in order to ensure that thirty percent of those admitted are locals. Tharaka-Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki asked the county government to improve the sub-county hospital to the required standards for the benefit of the locals and the students. He said some of the multi-million medical equipment leased to the county back in year 2016 were yet to be put into use in the hospital due to lack of specialists to operate them and insufficient electricity. Prof Kindiki, who is also the Senate deputy speaker, said the medical students who will be doing their practical at the Tharaka Sub-County Hospital will boost manpower hence better health services at the facility. Tharaka MP Gitonga Murugara said his office will set aside Sh20 million every year for the college. He said the school will also boost economy of the region and asked county government and other national government leaders to support it. This will be the second KMTC campus from that in Chuka town, Chuka/Igambangâ€™ombe constituency established three years ago.
