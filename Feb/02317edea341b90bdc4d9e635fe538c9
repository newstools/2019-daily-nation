The High Court in Kakamega has dismissed a case against government’s decision to crackdown on gambling machines. The decision by Justice Jesse Njagi, means that western Regional Commissioner Ann Ng’etich can continue with her crusade to get rid of the gaming businesses in the region. The case was filed by three businessmen – Kipkemboi Keter, Wesley Kipkemboi and Wesley Maria. In an affidavit sworn on July 12, 2018 Mr Kipkemboi, on behalf of the other two applicants, claimed that they operate gambling businesses in most parts of the country without interference. The trio wanted the court to issue an order restraining government officials from conducting the crackdown. In his ruling, noted that the petitioners failed to present to the court documented proof to demonstrate that they would suffer loses if the directive was to be implemented. “The conclusion is that the motion before the court is devoid of merit and is poorly conceived. I hereby dismiss the same with costs to the respondent,” ruled Justice Njagi. The judge also said that the petitioners had not attached documents to show they were in the business and operated in the premises mentioned in their affidavits. “They ought to place documentary proof before the court that they run these businesses. They could have done this by attaching licenses of the same,” he added.   Interior CAS Patrick ole Ntutu says the machines have destroyed families and kept children and youths out of school.
