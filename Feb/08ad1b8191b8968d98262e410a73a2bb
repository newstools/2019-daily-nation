Kenya Forest Service (KFS) rangers accused of assaulting four journalists in Nyeri County today evening have been interdicted. The decision by acting Chief Conservator of Forests Monica Kalenda to interdict the three officers has been endorsed by the agency's board chairman, Mr Peter Kinyua. "We are investigating to ascertain how many rangers were involved. There was a commotion between two groups but that does not allow us to behave that way. Our job is to protect forests and not to attack or chase away civilians with firearms," Mr Kinyua said. The Royal Media Services' reporters - Mr Emilio Muriithi, Mr Martin Munene and Mr Samuel Mbogo - were attacked by the officers when chaos erupted at Kabaru during the handover ceremony of the leadership of Community Forest Association. The Community Forest Association supervises the shamba system, where communities living around the forest are allowed to farm as they take care of trees. The journalists recorded statements at Naromoru Police Station. Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko assured them that the matter will be investigated further and disciplinary action taken.   Osoro says an officer hit his right hand with a baton and crashed his camera.
