Police will conduct an identification parade of six people linked to the murder of human rights activist Caroline Mwatha as part of ongoing investigations. In an affidavit filed in court on Wednesday, detectives said the suspects’ phone data as well as the clothes the slain activist wore on February 6 will be subjected to a forensic analysis. The affidavit presented in court by lead investigator Chief Inspector Joseph Wanjohi further states that the murder weapons used by the suspects will be analysed. On Tuesday, police claimed that Mwatha died while procuring an abortion in a clinic in Dandora but the affidavit presented before Makadara Chief Magistrate does not mention the cause of her death. SUSPECTS DETAINED Through a statement, Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti said the suspects were arrested over Mwatha’s alleged botched abortion and disposal of her body. Her family was informed that her body was at the City Mortuary six days after she went missing. On Wednesday, the court allowed police to detain the Mr Michael Onchiri, Ms Betty Akinyi, Ms Richard Ramoya Abudo, Ms Georgia Achieng Tabitha, Ms Alexander Gitau Gikonya and Ms Stephen Maina for 14 days for their own safety. The suspects were ordered detained in various undisclosed police stations within Buruburu police division. Their case will be mentioned on April 27 for further directions.   "The body has a very big cut on the thigh, how can that be an abortion?," Mwatha's husband said.
