Garbage collection, planning and maintenance of roads, and animal control in Meru County urban centres will now be managed by members of the public through committees. The committees will also be responsible for drawing plans to foster economic, social and environmental order besides promoting peaceful coexistence among communities, Governor Kiraitu Murungi said. Sub-county and town administrators as well as chiefs have also been incorporated into the committees for easy coordination of national and county government activities. “We are paying keen attention to development of our urban areas to make them centres of growth and development since our urban population is growing rapidly,” Mr Murungi said on Wednesday when he named members of committees for five main towns in the county. “We don’t want a situation where my government is blamed for things such as failure to collect garbage. The committees should work with county departments to ensure that all services are delivered." Mr Murungi said the county first registered traders in all towns and market in associations whose members have already chosen their leaders. The governor said Maua, Laare, Minkinduri, Timau and Nkubu towns will all be elevated to municipalities. TEAM LEADERS Town administrators will serve as secretaries of the committees while area chiefs will be ex-officio members. The governor said the development was part of his campaign promise for an inclusive administration that will empower Meru people to take control of their own development agenda. Former MP Mathew Karauri will chair Minkinduri committee, Mr Michael Mugambi Kabogo (Nkubu), Mr Andrew Mutuuria (Laare), Mr Geoffrey Kimathi (Timau) and Dr Samuel Kaumbuthu  (Maua). Mr Murungi has urged the public to support the committees.
