ABUJA President Muhammadu Buhari called for Nigerians "to refrain from all civil disorder and remain peaceful" after a last-minute postponement to Saturday's presidential election where he was standing for a second term. Nigeria's electoral body had in the early morning hours announced a one-week delay to presidential and legislative elections that were to begin across Africa's most-populous country at 0700 GMT on Saturday.   Buhari's campaign spokesman hits out at INEC for being unprepared.
