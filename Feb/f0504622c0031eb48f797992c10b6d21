A Nairobi court has allowed Marianne Kitany to remain in the Runda house jointly owned by Meru Senator Mithika Linturi pending determination of a case she has filed over sharing multi-million shilling assets. Senior principal magistrate Isaac Orege also barred Mr Linturi from entering the house but the order does not affect their children. Mr Orege said Maryanne has given testimony to show she contributed immensely to the construction the matrimonial home. He directed the parties to observe the law and shun domestic violence. The magistrate allowed Ms Kitany to remain in the house until the divorce and property cases are determined.
