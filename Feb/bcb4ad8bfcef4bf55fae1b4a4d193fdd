A 35-year old church official has been charged with defiling a Form Three student before forcing her to procure an abortion. Mr Charles Koronya, chairman of Ruiri Deliverance Church in Buuri sub county, denied the charges before Meru Resident Magistrate Edward Tsimonjero on Thursday . He was released on a Sh200,000 bond for defiling the teenager and a similar one for forcing her to procure an abortion. Mr Koronya is said to have lured the 17-year-old girl on December 19, 2018 before defiling her at a lodging in Isiolo town. He is said to have promised to take the girl for a short trip which ended at a hotel room, some27 kilometres from her home. STOMACH PAINS The defilement was not reported until February 3 this year when the girl experienced severe stomach pains after she tried to procure an abortion. The girl, who is also a member of Mr Koronyaâ€™s church, is said to have informed the accused that she was pregnant. The teenager claimed that the accused advised her to procure an abortion. The church official then bought three tablets which he advised the girl to take for three days. He assured her that the abortion would be successful. SEVERE PAINS However, the student later experienced severe stomach pains before collapsing as she played with her friends. Mr Koronya, who was represented by lawyer Audrey Mbijiwe, asked the court to grant him lenient bond terms. He also asked for witness statements and exhibits, which the court ordered he be given. The case, whose hearing has been set for February 28, will be heard on April 10, 2019.
