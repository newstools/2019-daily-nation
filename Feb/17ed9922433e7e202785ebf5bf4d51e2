A man was on Friday jailed for 15 years after he was found guilty of being in possession of items intended for use in perpetrating terror. Mr Ramadhan Adam Athman, 32, was in possession of video clips, written oaths among other literature which he planned to use to radicalise youths, contrary to the Prevention of Terrorism Act. He was arrested by the Anti-Terrorist Police Unit on June 2016 after residents of Kipkaren estate in Eldoret raised alarm. When delivering the ruling, Eldoret Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa argued that even though the accused denied being a member of militant group Al-Shabaab, the videos found in his possession indicated that he was either a follower or a sympathiser. DUSIT State counsel Juliet Busienei said the members of public suspected that Mr Athman together with others not before court were plotting to carry out terror activities. His lawyer Chacha A. Mwita said: "Your honour, though my client was found with the said articles there are no records to associate him with terrorism; no evidence has been produced in court confirming that he was a member of outlawed Al-Shabaab group." Mr Athman has 14 days to appeal. The judgment comes as the government intensifies its fight against terrorism following the attack on DusitD2 complex in Nairobi two weeks ago. The attack, which Shabaab claimed responsibility, killed 21 people and left several others injured.   ATPU closes file after investigation finds no links to the crime.
