Mathare United rallied from a goal down to hold Soy Sugar to a 1-1 draw at Awendo on Thursday. Tobias Otieno handed the hosts the lead in the 64th minute with a brilliant free kick, before Chrispin Oduor levelled from the spot with only 10 minutes left. The Slum Boys had the best chance of the opening quarter but Oduor lost his footing as he connected to a low cross from Clifford Alwanga on the right. Tobias thought he had broken the deadlock but his pile driver from range was comfortably gathered by the well-positioned Allan Owiny. Mathare wasted a glorious opportunity to score from a freekick. Kevin Kimani in-swinger was met by a feeble header from Oduor at the back post which barely troubled Sony custodian Kevin Omondi. But it was from another set-piece that the visitors almost went ahead. On 54 minutes, Kimani sent his delivery from a corner at the near post where Clifford Nyakeya cleverly flicked the ball past Omondi only for his effort to come off the bar. Then the moment the sizeable crowd at Awendo awaited finally arrived. David Owino gave away a cheap freekick at the edge of the box after needlessly pushing Daniel Otieno from behind. Otieno stepped forward and his execution was perfect, the ball coming off the inside of the crossbar to land into the net beyond Owiny’s delivery. Francis Kimanzi reacted with a double substitution introducing Daniel Mwaura and Ahmed Ahmad for the jaded pair of Kevin Kimani and James Kinyanjui. That tactical change tipped the scales his side’s way and ten minutes later Sony cracked. Kennedy Owino tripped Alwanga in the box and Hosea Omondi awarded Mathare a penalty that was expertly converted by Oduor. The draw leaves Mathare United top with 25 points, three ahead of second-placed Bandari who have a game in hand.   Follow the Thursday afternoon KPL action live here.
