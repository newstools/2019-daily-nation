A fire destroyed property at a dormitory in Nyamanga Mixed Secondary School, Homa Bay County, on Saturday. About 195 students were rescued following the incident at about 3am at the school in Upper Kayambo. Some jumped out of the facility's windows but no injuries were reported. According to Parents Teachers Association (PTA) chairman Dan Nyakwana, the Nyamanga management suspects that a group of seven students started the fire. Mr Nyakwana said the seven were suspended last week for sneaking out. "The suspects went to a disco matanga at a village next to the school. They had to be sent home for disobeying the rules. However, one was spotted trying to get back into the compound at night three days ago," he said, adding the person had a jerrican they believed contained petrol. "He threatened the head boy and other officials, saying he would attack then. The suspect argued that the officials were behind his suspension." Ndhiwa divisional police commander Dishon Chadaka said students, teachers and members of the public tried in vain to put out the fire. "We have launched investigations into what happened. We appeal to those with information on what might have happened to share it with police," he said.   .   Students say mattresses easily catch and spread fire.
