It’s encouraging that Kenya hosted 13 professionals from the Ladies European Tour (LET) for a series pro-Am at Vipingo Ridge last weekend, with the government committing Sh63 million for the hosting of a full LET on the same course later this year. The lady pros teamed up with more than 40 local amateurs, including fast-rising Naomi Naliaka, for the Ladies Invitational Pro-Am. However, the organisers of the Pro-Am event ought to have been considerate to the local players by charging them a favourable entry fee — not the Sh150,000 levied at Vipingo. Kenyan ladies have been starved of quality action for many years. That led to the legendary Rose Naliaka turning professional some years back. But with no ladies’ professional action, Rose has concentrated her energies on developing golfers, including Naomi. The visit by the pros from LET, who were making a stopover in the country on their way to Australia, comes a month before Kenya hosts its first European Tour event, Magical Kenya Open, on March 14-17 at Karen Country Club, Nairobi. Kenya Open has had its status elevated from the Challenge Tour to a main tour event with the government putting in Sh268 million. That means it will not only attract a better field, but golfing will also, for the first time, be televised live from Kenya to almost 450 million homes across the world. This will expose the country to the world and will improve tourism. Kenya has some of the best courses to host major events, but stakeholders need to first promote golf as a sports tourism venture.
