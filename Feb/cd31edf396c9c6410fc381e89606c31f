Mildred Odira, whose body has been found at City Mortuary days after she went missing, suffered several injuries before her death. A post-mortem is yet to establish the exact cause of death but Ms Odira's body had two wounds on the face and a crushed lower section. Her trouser was torn at the top and her underwear partly lowered. Records at the morgue showed the body was taken there by Kasarani traffic police officers at 6.31am last Tuesday. Her identity was unknown at the time. LAST SEEN Ms Odira, who worked as a switchboard operator at Foresight company, which is based at Nation Centre, was last seen on Tuesday at 4am by security guards in Kariobangi South where she lived. The guards hailed a taxi for her so she could be taken to hospital as she had been diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension and ulcers. Questioned by Ms Odira's family on Friday, the taxi driver said he dropped her at Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital and that he left after about 20 minutes. But according to the hospital records seen by the Nation, the driver entered the hospital gates at 4.30am and left at 5.57am. Administrators at the mortuary said the officers alluded to finding Ms Odira's body in Mwiki and a source in the family said they asked police to find out if she was murdered on that day.   Mildred Odira was last seen at 4am on Tuesday in Kariobangi South.
