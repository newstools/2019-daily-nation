A 25-year-old- man has hacked his wife to death before committing suicide in Kitoben village in Keringet, Nakuru County. Mr Benard Kipkemoi Maritim is said to have committed the heinous act on Saturday night. While confirming the incident, Assistant Chief Peter Lang’at identified the woman as a secondary school teacher at a local school. “The man used a kitchen knife to slit his wife’s throat before hanging himself using a string inside their bedroom,’’ said Mr Lang’at. GUARD Mr Lang’at said the man, a security guard in Nakuru, became unhappy after he discovered that his wife had visited her parents who live at a neighbouring village. Neighbours found the woman’s body in a pool of blood while that of the man was found dangling from the roof. The bodies were moved to Molo Sub-County Hospital mortuary. GUIDANCE The administrator urged couples to seek assistance from guidance and counselling departments in the county. Mr Lang’at said such incidents had become common in the area. The incident comes only two weeks after a 30-year-old man brutally killed his father over Sh100 at Kalyet village in Elburgon, Nakuru County. Mr Wilson Yegon, 65, died on the spot after his son Eric Kibiwott hit him on the head with an axe.   Police are looking for the woman who fled after the incident.
