Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata now says his political allegiance lies with President Uhuru Kenyatta, whom he notes will give Mt Kenya direction as he is the "kingpin". The senator, seen as Deputy President William Ruto's staunch supporter, noted that he respects him so he will not campaign against him and his bid to become head of State come 2022. While serving as Kiharu MP, Mr Kang'ata organised several meetings for the DP and even told his supporters that they would vote for him. "He has been my friend ... that's why I don't malign him and his presidential bid," he said. TONING DOWN The senator explained that he chose the President's side to minimise politicking for the sake of development. Mr Kang'ata, also the Senate Deputy Chief Whip, said he heeded Mr Kenyatta's call against early campaigning for focus on service delivery. Last year, Mr Kenyatta surprised leaders and residents when he told them to tone down on politics and that his choice come 2022 would surprise many. Mr Kang'ata said, "I choose to abide by the directive of the President and I will wait for his direction on where the Mt Kenya region will be in the 2022 game plan." GROUPINGS Mr Kangata's statement came a few days after the Mt Kenya and Diaspora Forum was formed with the aim of defending the President against Tanga Tanga squad that is allied to Dr Ruto. The group, led by nominated MP Maina Kamanda and former Presidential candidates Martha Karua and Peter Kennethn will criss-cross the country to counter their rivals activities. Next Sunday, the battalion will pitch tent in Kangema, whose MP Muturi Kigano is a member. Other members of the team in Murang'a include Mathioya MP Peter Kimari and Kigumo's Ruth Mwaniki. Muranga Women Representative Sabina Chege has dismissed the group, calling those behind it political losers who want to find favour with the President.   A section of Murang’a leaders are accusing area senator of secluding them from the DP’s tours
