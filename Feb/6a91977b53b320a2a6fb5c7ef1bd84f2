Loudly over, under, and, out, was Galieo Star, when Silverstone Air flicked his wand with a 9.5 length crushing, in Sunday's Britam Kenya Guineas. Fast Five, Kidnap, and, Go Pro, were equally without purchasing power, as Silverstone Air (James Muhindi), owned by Captain Sornow, chiselled away solo for trainer's Joe Karari and Captain Oruya. Amazingly, the atmosphere was so pumped, it did not matter that it was a one-sided Classic. We cannot go without saying Silverstone Air is not from this Galaxy! Molto braaaavo. Entrancing riding from invited jockey's, Dinesh Sooful, Brendon McNaughton, Eric Saziso Ngwane, who definitely enhanced this meeting, Zimbabwe won the Challenge with Brendon McNaughton. The Parachutists were a big hit with spectators. Fun seeing Maralynn Bengough, Joe Muya, Gilly Fraser, and, Wakini Ndegwa, winging it with their respective steeds. Pharoah's Advocate ran quite conservatively compared to his compatriot, Navy Seal, in the Nakuru Race Club Cup. As Paragon and El Mundo, were not enjoying a mile. They are better suited for sprinting. NGONG RESULTS 1.10 pm - First Race - Britam Micro Insurance Maiden (1,800m) 1. La Cha Cha (Dinesh Sooful - Mauritius) 2. Karowe (Brendon McNaughton) 3.
