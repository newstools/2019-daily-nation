A court has summoned Wajir Speaker Ibrahim Yakub for failing to declare the Buna Batalu seat vacant following a court order. Mr Yakub did not adhere to the directive within the 21 days he was given on February 2, and is yet to. Senior Resident Magistrate Amos Makoros earlier declared Mr Ibrahim Noor Hussein's election null and void, saying it was neither free nor fair. The court then directed the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to hold fresh elections. The Speaker, however, did not declare the vacant status of the seat, sparking criticism by some leaders whose accused him of looking down upon the courts. Hassan Jimal Abdi, the complainant in the matter, on Friday expressed his displeasure with the Speaker's actions. In a letter to Mr Yakub, dated February 8,  magistrate Makoros termed the matter urgent and ordered him to appear in court to show why he should not be committed to civil jail. The Speaker did not respond to calls and messages for comment on the matter, which will be heard on February 22.   Court cites irregularities at Qara polling station.
