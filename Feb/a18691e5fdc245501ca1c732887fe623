Onkar Rai recorded a hat-trick of Nakuru Rally victories following his latest win on Saturday driving a Skoda Fabia. Rai, who had won the Rift Valley Motor Sports Club event in 2017 and 2018, scored four fastest stage times to finish a mere 4.8 seconds ahead of second-placed Carl Tundo in a Mitsubishi Lancer EvoX at the end of the 324km event. ''I am excited with the victory. To be honest I didn't sleep last night. We swapped times in each of the stages today but it was very close. I am happy for the team, myself and my sponsors Menengai Oil. Beating one of the top drivers in the series is special and fantastic,'' said Rai Though, Tundo also scored equal number of four fastest stage times, the current Kenya National Rally Drivers Champion lost out on winning the 2019 KCB Nakuru Rally by one of the smallest margins in the history of the KNRC series. Tundo won six out of eight rounds of last year's national rally series. It was a one-two-three top finish for the Menengai Rally Team with Baldev Chager (Mitsubishi Lancer EvoX) coming in third. The Nakuru Rally, which attracted 20 competitors, was the first of the eight-round national series that is under the sponsorship of Kenya Commercial Bank for the next three years. The Safari Rally, which will be a FIA Candidate Event this year, will also be supported by KCB with a sponsorship deal to be announced soon. Ian Duncan, a past multiple winner of the Nakuru Rally, retired with fuel problem in a Nissan pickup. Eric Bengi, John Nganga and Edward Maina also retired. Karan Patel finished in ninth position driving a Subaru Impreza on his return to action after an accident in a round of the Tanzania Rally Championship last year. He finished behind Issa Amwari in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10. The next round of KNRC series will be staged by the Kenya Motor Sports Club in Nairobi on March 2 and 3.
