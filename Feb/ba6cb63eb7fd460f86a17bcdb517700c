Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards, Kenya’s perennial football arch-rivals, clash today in a traditionally explosive league match at Kasarani. This is a heated fixture that usually evokes high emotions, regardless the form of either team at kick-off. Statistics have Gor and Leopards level at 27 wins apiece with this eagerly-awaited fixture having produced 31 draws. With Gor having won the league 17 times to Leopards’ 12, there will be everything to play for in today’s big clash. CLUBS STRUGGLING Especially with both teams somewhat struggling for domestic form, with defending champions Gor fourth on the log with 19 points and Leopards further down at 15th with 10 points and eerily hugging the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Leopards have just signed yet another coach, Rwandan Andre Casa Mbungo, while Gor will have another eye on their midweek fixture in Angola against Petro de Luanda in the Caf Confederation Cup next Wednesday. These sideshows provide the right ingredients for an interesting duel. While we urge fans to turnout in numbers to witness today’s delicately-poised derby, we also call for decorum, irrespective of the outcome. HOOLIGANISM Sadly, this fixture has more often than not been associated with acts of hooliganism, including destruction of property at the match venue, which has been a great turnoff for many. Both Gor and AFC have had a fair share of violence and got away with it. Individual clubs should be held liable for any damage or acts of hooliganism by their supporters or officials as one way of stamping out football violence. Only then can supporters and sponsors troop for matches such as today’s derby.
