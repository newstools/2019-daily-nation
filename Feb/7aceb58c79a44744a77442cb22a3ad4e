The government on Thursday insisted all recent envoys appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta will be deployed to their duty stations when the time comes, downplaying fears over their delayed departure. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under which management of diplomatic missions falls, said each of the diplomats will undergo a separate schedule to prepare and depart for their stations as is the practice globally. “Every host country is ready to receive them and have begun to do so. Every country schedules the presentation ceremonies at specific times depending on their traditions and availability of the Head of State,” the Ministry said in a statement. RIO OLYMPICS The Ministry was responding to a Nation article revealing that a number of recent diplomats appointed last July have yet to present their credentials to the heads of states where they were assigned. And amid the confusion, two of those envoys, Dr Hassan Wario and Richard Ekai, are fighting to clear their names in Kenyan courts over allegations they misappropriated money for the Kenyan team at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. The charges mean they will be unable to settle down in their duty stations, at least until they are cleared. On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry Principal Secretary Macharia Kamau told the Nation the delay in the departure of the envoys has not affected the work of missions abroad, arguing in fact appointees may take longer to depart for their stations depending on the nature of the work they are supposed to do.   Kamau said the ambassadors will report to their stations anytime now,.
