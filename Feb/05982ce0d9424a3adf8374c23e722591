Two bodies, including one of an infant, were on Saturday evening retrieved from two beaches in Bondo, Siaya County. Fishermen found the baby's body floating in Lake Victoria at Goye beach and called police. It was said that the child was last seen with a woman believed to have been the mother and that she may have intended to commit suicide. Usenge Assistant Chief Manase Osuri said the two may have drowned. “We had reports that a woman had drowned. Investigations will establish whether it was an accident or suicide,” said Mr Osuri. He said the woman's identity had not been established but that police were searching for her. SWIMMING The second body - that of a 19-year-old Form Four student, was found at Ugambe beach. Pascal Ogwae, who attended Kapiyo Mixed Secondary School, is said to have drowned while swimming. East Yimbo Chief Julius Odemba told the Nation that he and friends had been fishing when they decided to bathe in the middle of the lake. “He jumped into the water in an attempt to swim but unfortunately drowned,” he said, adding the others tried unsuccessfully to save him. Mr Odemba advised fishermen and other people to be careful when they go to the lake. The bodies were taken to the Bondo Sub-county Hospital mortuary.   The boat was overloaded with 10 of them, says Nyatike OCPD John Musili.
