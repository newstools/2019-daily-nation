LIVERPOOL Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was forced to name a makeshift centre-back pairing of Joel Matip and Fabinho for his side's Champions League last 16, first leg at home to Bayern Munich on Tuesday. Talismanic Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk is suspended, while fellow centre-backs Joe Gomez and Dejan Lovren are injured, forcing Brazilian midfielder Fabinho to start in an unfamiliar role. Klopp does have more options in midfield where Naby Keita keeps his place with James Milner left on the bench. Roberto Firmino has also recovered from a virus that saw the Brazilian miss training on Monday to take his place up front alongside Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Bayern also have problems with injury and illness with Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Corentin Tolisso missing, but Kingsley Coman is passed fit to start after scoring twice against Augsburg on Friday before suffering an ankle injury. Franck Ribery only makes the bench after arriving in Liverpool after the rest of the squad on Monday having attended the birth of his daughter.
