Telecommunications firm Safaricom has joined the growing list of firms eyeing lucrative contracts to digitise revenue collection at malls and hospitals after unveiling a platform that allows motorists to pay for parking through mobile money platform M-Pesa. Safaricom has partnered with Kenya Airports Parking Services (Kaps) to launch the service that will see the solutions provider integrate M-Pesa to its platform, thus allowing cashless payments at more than 50 locations across the country including malls and hospitals. “We realised that parking is one of the services that still relies heavily on cash and there was a gap for us to offer our customers convenience, ease and simplicity to pay parking fees,” said Safaricom chief financial services officer Sitoyo Lopokoiyoit. “Motorists can now enjoy the freedom from having to carry around cash, the hassle of looking for change and queuing simply to pay for parking.” The service can be accessed by dialling *486#, which will then enable customers to make parking payments with M-Pesa. The partnership will also enable customers to use its Tap-To-Pay and Scan-To-Pay for payments systems in place of the Kaps card to access and exit parking lots. “Kaps has been on a journey to drive cashless parking payments and we are glad to partner with Safaricom in this initiative,” Kaps chief executive Bonnyventure Saronge said. The firms said the service is already live at 52 locations including in Nairobi, Kisumu, Eldoret, Mombasa, Nanyuki and Nakuru.
