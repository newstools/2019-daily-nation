A police officer from Murang'a County has died by suicide in a case believed to have resulted from a domestic squabble. The body of Administration Police Constable Mephis Ng'ang'a Gathungu, 31, was found in the bathroom of his rented house in the town. The officer, who was employed in 2011 and was based in Igembe North, Meru County, hanged himself. Residents found the body after a bad smell prompted them to check the officer's house. They then alerted police. An officer who did not want to be named said Mr Gathungu likely took his own life three to four days before his body was found. DEPRESSION Mr Gathungu's father, James Gathungu Ng'ang'a, told the Nation that his son and his wife had separated and that he had been mentally unstable. "Although they have been having issues, they were together last Tuesday. The wife cooked supper for him before leaving," he said. "He suffered from depression." According to the Criminal Investigations Department, Mr Gathungu applied for a seven-day leave on January 21 to solve domestic issues. However, he did not return to work on January 28 and extended the leave. SIGNS Another officer who requested anonymity, due to lack of authority to speak to the media, said Mr Gathungu had exhibited worrying signs. "He had suicidal thoughts and could not be trusted with a gun due to the depression," the source said. Samuel Gichia, Karuri Sub-location Assistant Chief, asked the public to seek counselling during trying times. "People are terminating their lives due to stress-related issues. I urge them to spare their families the pain and consider the services of qualified counsellors in case of issues such as depression," he told the Nation.   Police say the suspect used shoe laces to kill himself.
