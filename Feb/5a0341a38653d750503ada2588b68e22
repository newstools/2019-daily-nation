Tusker were on Thursday held to a 1-1 draw by Bandari in a SportPesa Premier League match played at Ruaraka Sports Grounds in Nairobi. Tusker were the first on the scoreboard through Boniface Muchiri but Wycliffe Ochomo came off the bench to ensure the visitors returned to Mombasa with a point.   Tusker jump to fourth with 19 points same us Gor Mahia and Western Stima while Bandari remain stagnant in second with 22 points, two behind leaders Mathare United. Boniface Muchiri was first in the score sheets, as he looped the ball over an onrushing Bandari custodian Farouk Shikhalo at the stroke of half time. Ugandan midfielder Hashim Sempala took the credit for providing the assist as the brewers went into the breather on a one-goal lead. Bandari’s equaliser came in the 65th minute when burly striker Wycliffe Ochomo, who had come on for Collins Agade, delivered a free header off a free kick that had been well taken by Ugandan William Wadri. Bandari’s coach Bernard Mwalala was sent off the field of play in the first minute of added time for clashing with the assistant referee at the touchline, leaving his assistant xy to take charge of the match. “The pitch is not that good and you can see that one of our players (Fred Nkata) has been injured. That has worked against us today but also credit to Tusker because they gave us a good challenge. I am happy with the single point,” said Bandari assistant coach Ken Odhiambo.
