Winning international accolades is no mean feat. It’s a recognition by experts in a particular field that one is doing an exemplary job in one’s area of specialisation. Kenya has, for many years, done quite well in athletics, winning numerous trophies and prizes. Another area where the country excels is in tourism. The Maasai Mara Game Reserve, for instance, has for the past six years been feted as the leading national park in the world, and with each successive crowning comes the pressure to either maintain that performance or improve on it. Coming as a bit of a surprise, though, is an apparent breakthrough in architecture with a new building in Nairobi, Britam Tower, now savouring international fame and glory. The 31-storey building in the upmarket Upper Hill area of Nairobi has just been named the top skyscraper in Africa at the global architecture awards announced in Germany. It bagged the Emporis Skyscraper Award, claiming Africa’s only spot among the top 10 buildings in the world. This is an achievement that proves that, despite horrible incidents such as the recent Dusit complex terrorist attack in Nairobi that claimed more than 20 innocent lives, rising general crime, the slaughter on the roads and other setbacks, the country is not all gloom and doom. It is a story of resilience and determination amid the looting of public resources and other forms of graft. The challenge for the leadership is to help create a conducive environment for growth and development to attract more quality investments such as this building, which sends a strong message to the world about the potential in Kenya. The achievers in athletics, the travel sector and now architecture, are a source of inspiration and can help to attract more foreign direct investment to boost the economy.
