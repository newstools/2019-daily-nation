Hundreds of women staged a protest in Chuka town Thursday to counter a similar one on Monday against Tharaka-Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki. On Monday, a group of women from Tharaka, Chuka/Igambang’ombe and Maara held demonstrations outside Governor Njuki’s office in Kathwana. They "cursed" Mr Njuki by dumping their underwear outside his office. On Thursday, another group of women marched along the streets singing songs to “bless” Mr Njuki and “cleanse” him of the curse. They accused Senator Kithure Kindiki, Woman Representative Beatrice Nkatha, Chuka/Igambang’ombe MP Patrick Munene and Tharaka MP Gitonga Murugara of funding the Monday demos.Police used teargas to disperse the protesters claiming that the demonstration was illegal. CHAOS Some women sustained injuries after falling down as they escaped from the chaos. The protesters denied the claims that the demos were illegal. A section of residents have urged leaders to shun their differences and unite in order to serve the locals well. Mr James Mutegi, a business man in Chuka town said due to the disagreements between the governor and other leaders, the county would lag behind in development projects. “We urge our leaders to unite and serve us rather than organise demonstrations against each other,” said Mr Mutegi.
