Ulinzi Stars' poor record at home continued on Saturday after being held to a 1-1 draw by Chemelil Sugar in a SportPesa Premier League match at the Afraha Stadium. The soldiers should blame themselves for dropping two vital points as they seemed not to have carried their shooting boots on a day they should have won convincingly if the dozen scoring chances they created are anything to go by. After wasting a golden opportunity in the 43rd minute, Elvis Nandwa put his act together to stab home the match opener for the soldiers in the 70th minute when he dribbled past a forest of defenders and unleashed a long range shot outside the box past goalkeeper Morgan Ahube. However, the lead was short-lived as Musa Oundo slotted in a penalty five minutes later after one of the Ulinzi defenders handled inside the box. This is the fifth consecutive draw at home for the soldiers who have only won once at their own backyard. “As much as the league is tough my strikers have let me down. In this particular match they were a big let-down and I am extremely disappointed by their performance,” said Ulinzi Stars coach Dunstan Nyaudo. Chemelil Sugar coach Francis Baraza was content with a point on the road. “It was a tough match and salvaging a point away from the soldiers is not bad after conceding the first goal,” said Baraza. In the 85th minute, the surging Chemelil sugar should have extended their lead but Tindi Biko's rasping shot came off the upright. Chemelil Sugar Francis Baraza made three changes introducing Francis Ocholla, Charles Okiya and James Omino and hauled off Justine Monda, Dominic Kiprono and Clifford Omondi a move that saw them pin the soldiers into their own half for the closing quarter. Nyaudo rested Bonventure Muchika, Mohammed Hassan and Daniel Waweru and brought in Boniface Andai, Ezekiel Okare and Mark Bikokwa but they could not find the winner.
