Deputy President William Ruto and Jubilee Secretary-General Raphael Tuju put aside their differences over the party’s presidential candidate in 2022 at a rare get-together yesterday. The two met at the Jubilee headquarters to present the party nomination certificate to former Wajir West MP Ahmed Kolosh, whose election was nullified by the Supreme Court in January. The meeting came following weeks of acrimony, with Mr Tuju and former Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe criticising Dr Ruto’s presidential bid. 2022 BID Even though Friday’s function was merely to introduce the Jubilee candidate for the April 25 by-election, it was not lost on observers that the DP delayed his visit to Tharaka-Nithi County to attend the burial of Governor Muthomi Njuki’s mother. The differences between Dr Ruto and Mr Murathe began in late December 2018 when the latter dismissed the DP’s bid at a function in Vihiga. And days later in Siaya, Mr Tuju and Mr Murathe repeated the message. CANDIDATE Mr Tuju said Dr Ruto is not the automatic Jubilee presidential candidate. He added that it is only the Jubilee National Delegates Convention that can pick the hopeful. “We have a President who is the party leader and a Deputy President who is the deputy party leader. We also have a Constitution showing how we appoint our presidential candidate. As far as I am concerned, nothing has changed,” Mr Tuju said. EMBRACE Mr Murathe would later resign from the party while vowing to move to court to block Dr Ruto’s candidacy. Mr Tuju and Dr Ruto embraced at the party headquarters when the DP handed Mr Kolosh the nomination certificate. Mr Tuju and National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale received Dr Ruto at the party headquarters.   He says current politics in Jubilee is ethnic-based with some people yet to embrace Uhuru-Raila handshake.
