A Nairobi family is looking for their kin who disappeared without a trace on Tuesday morning after she went to hospital seeking treatment. Ms Mildred Odira, who works as a switchboard operator for Foresight company based at Nation Centre, was last seen at 4am by security guards where she lives in Kariobangi South. They had helped her hail a taxi to take her to Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital. Her sister Maureen Anyango said the family has visited several hospitals looking for the mother of one in vain. After speaking to the taxi operator, he told them he took Ms Odira to the hospital and left after 20 minutes. But according to the hospital records seen by this writer, the driver entered the hospital gates at 4:30am and left at 5:57am, which contradicted what he had told her kin. The hospital’s management says it’s still combing through the CCTV footage to ascertain what the taxi driver was doing at the facility for that long.
