The long-drawn out clamour for South Sudan’s independence, it was hoped, would resolve its recurrent famines. However, after nearly a decade of self-rule, Juba has clearly failed to guarantee the people their most basic need: Food security. The hunger pangs are once again ringing loudly in the youngest nation, now best known for conflict. Aid agencies have warned that tens of thousands of South Sudanese risk starvation. The grim picture has been corroborated by the government. Both say nearly seven million people, or two-thirds of the population, were in dire need of food aid, and the figure could rise. Though endowed with vast land with enviable agricultural potential, the great majority of South Sudanese have never enjoyed a peaceful environment in which they could fend for themselves. Decades of the struggle for independence from their northern former compatriots claimed at least two million lives. South Sudan’s independence came in 2011 following a self-determination referendum. Just three years later, in 2013, the dream was shattered when war broke out between factions loyal to President Salva Kiir and his then-deputy, Dr Riek Machar. A peace deal last September had raised hopes for a return to normalcy. However, even before that deal could be consolidated, a new war front was increasing, taking its toll on the young nation. The fighting is concentrated in Equatoria in the south and pits government forces against those of renegade Gen Thomas Cirilo Swaka, the leader of the National Salvation Front (NAS). In the circumstances, the government has continued investing heavily in defence as opposed to food and other basic needs that are closer to the ordinary people’s hearts. The corrupt are having a field day, looting State resources as the common people starve. It is high time Juba came to terms with the reality of donor fatigue, ended the war and provided for the welfare of its citizens.
