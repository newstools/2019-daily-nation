The government moved in last week to rescue one of top community football clubs, AFC Leopards, from imminent collapse, when Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa handed the Kenyan Premier League side Sh2 million, but after giving the management a dressing down for its run of poor results. He was categorical that the club officials must put their act together. Leopards are staring at relegation, as the club is placed 17th in the 18-team top-tier league with 10 points from 13 matches. This is not the first time the Ministry of Sports is bailing out a community club, having, at almost the same time last year, come to the rescue of  the Leopards and fellow giants Gor Mahia to enable them to honour their continental assignments. It’s sad that Leopards and Gor, two of the most established clubs in the country, are still moving around with bowl in hand. These are clubs, which are in the league with Tanzania’s Yanga and Simba, which are doing well. Some years back, then President Daniel arap Moi allocated these two famous Kenyan clubs land in Embakasi, Nairobi, which was enough to build stadiums for training and flats for players. Nobody knows what happened to the land. The government should not be bailing out such clubs at this time when they are supposed to be self-sustainable. It’s through fans’ support that these clubs raise funds. It’s from transparent and accountable management, besides good results on the pitch, that fans will troop back to the stadiums and sponsors will be in plenty. As for the fans, staying away on match day and complaining about a club’s poor performance doesn’t help the team, either.
