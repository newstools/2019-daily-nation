The National Cross Country Championships which will be held in Eldoret Sports Club, Uasin Gishu on Saturday will be aired live by NTV from 2pm. The event which is taking place outside Nairobi for the first time is expected to attract more than 10,000 fans in the athletics hub. NTV has partnered with the county government of Uasin Gishu to bring this event, which will be curtain-raised by NTV's premier sports show - "Top Sport", live. According to the head of television Justus Tharao, NTV is committed to support sportspersons as they fly Kenya’s flag high. "We have invested in a fully equipped broadcast studio in Eldoret in a bid to promote and expose the sports talent in North rift region and beyond," said Tharao. “We will also be hosting weekly live shows from Eldoret studio to enhance visibility of various talents in this region,” he added. Viewers will be able to catch their favourite athletes live from the grounds who include defending champion Geoffrey Kamworor, World Cross Country silver medallist Leonard Barsoton, Agnes Tirop among others. Thereafter, a team will be selected to represent Kenya in the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark next month.
