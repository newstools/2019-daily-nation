Western Bulls RFC Saturday thrashed South Coast Pirates RFC 39-6 in the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship league match at Echulusi Bull Ring in Kakamega. Bulls touched down their tries through a hat-trick of tries from Suleiman Abubakar while Andrew Odhiambo, Billy Luseno, Dan Chebui and Derrick Ashihundu grabbed a try apiece. Ashihundu and Abubakar successfully converted their tries. Kevin Amiani scored two penalties for the coastal outfit. Western Bull’s coach Bramwel Shikanda was elated at his team’s victory. "It was team work that immensely contributed to our victory," he said. South Coast Pirates tactician Lawrence Buyachi attributed their defeat to the weather. "My boys could not withstand the harsh weather in Kakamega and that is why we lost with a very huge margin," said Buyachi, a former Nakuru RFC player. Bulls used home advantage well that saw Chebui secure a converted try five minutes into the match. The visitors reduced the deficit in the 14th minute after Amiani hit through the poles a penalty, but before the dust could settle Abubakar touched down an unconverted try. Odhiambo was on the mark to deliver an unconverted try for Bulls. Moments later, Amiani scored another penalty as Bulls led 17-6 at the breather. On resumption, Bulls capitalized on defensive lapses from their opponents to touch down two unconverted tries through Ashihundu and Abubakar. Luseno scored a converted try for Bulls to seal the fate of their opponents.
