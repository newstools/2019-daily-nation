Three men were on Monday charged with fraudulently obtaining Sh1.2 million from Kakamega residents with the promise of getting children recruited by the Kenya Defence Forces. They are facing 13 counts of defrauding the public from February 20 to June 18, 2018 while posing as KDF officers. Andrew Musungu, Josephat Barasa and Reagan Shahenza allegedly committed the offence in Lurambi township. They allegedly conned Ms Mary Abona of Sh733,250 by pretending they were in a position to help her son get recruited by the military. The three are also accused of defrauding the parents of Ms Faith Khaombi of Sh504,650. “The accused face separate charges of forging KDF identification cards and purporting to be genuine,” prosecutor Paul Juma further told the court. He also pointed out that the first accused had skipped court in a case in which he is charged with the same offence. The three suspects denied the charges when they appeared before Kakamega Chief magistrate Bildad Ochieng’. Mr Juma asked the court to reject Mr Musungu's application to be released on bond, arguing he was earlier freed on a Sh100,000 bond but committed a similar offence. The magistrate ruled that the first accused remain in police custody until Tuesday and that the second and third accused be released on Sh1 million bond each. The case will be heard on May 9.
