Two people died in Maragua, Murang’a County on Thursday after their boat sank in Mariiki Dam. Murang’a South police boss John Onditi said the two men had come from Nairobi for work and decided to explore the dam. “A boatman took them around but a few minutes into the adventure, the boat capsized,” the police boss said. Mr Onditi said the boatman was able to swim to safety but the other two drowned. He said the bodies of the men are yet to be retrieved from the dam. Meanwhile, another person died in a dam about three kilometres away from Mariiki Dam after he slipped and fell into the water while fishing. The police boss urged locals and strangers to avoid involving themselves in such adventures without the presence of professionals to prevent deaths. “No one should engage himself in swimming or fishing expedition without the assistance of professionals because doing so is risking their lives,” he said.
