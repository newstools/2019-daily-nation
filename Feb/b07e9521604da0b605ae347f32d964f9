A magistrate’s court set free a single mother who was charged with preparing food in unsanitary conditions, after informing the court that she did it to fend for her children. Ms Josey Karendi tearfully told resident magistrate Edward Tsimonjero how she fell victim to a deadbeat dad who abandoned her and her child. Carrying her five-month-old daughter on her back, the woman, who is in her mid-20s, said selling food by the roadside was her only way of earning a living. She cried as the charges were read to her and the magistrate asked her if the facts were correct. Ms Karendi explained that she has been forced to start preparing and selling food by a roadside after her boyfriend left on learning she was pregnant. “Tulikuwa tunakaa na yeye lakini wakati nilipata mimba akaniwacha na sijawahi muona tangu wakati huo (we were cohabiting but when learnt that I was pregnant he disappeared and I have never seen her since then),” she told Mr Tsimonjero. The magistrate said the circumstances that led her to commit the crime were touching and set her free, but urged her to improve hygiene at her place of work. “We have listened to your mitigation and the circumstances under which the offence was committed. Consequently, the accused is discharged 35 (1) of the penal code. You must strive to maintain high standards of hygiene,” said Mr Tsimonjero.
