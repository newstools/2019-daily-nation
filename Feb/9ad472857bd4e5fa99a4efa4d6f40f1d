The High Court has ordered a psychiatric examination to be conducted on a Form Two student accused of killing a secondary school teacher. Justice Janet Mulwa on Monday directed that the 18-year-old student be taken for mental assessment at the Nakuru Level Five Hospital before he takes plea. The Tumaini Secondary School student appeared in court but did not respond to the charges of killing Mr Peter Mogusu Omare, a Physics teacher at Hopewell Secondary School in Nakuru. Mr Omare was killed on January 24 after being attacked and hit by blunt object on the head. “The suspect should be taken to the hospital on Wednesday for a mental assessment before he takes plea in court,” ruled Justice Mulwa in Nakuru. FINALLY CHARGED The suspect was finally charged on Monday after spending 10 days at the Nakuru Central Police Station. Senior Resident Magistrate Yvonne Khatambi had on Friday given the police until Monday to charge the suspect who was first arraigned in court on January 28. RELEASED ON BOND The suspect, however, failed to take plea on Friday when he appeared in court after the police sought for an extension of time to complete their investigations. The court dismissed an attempt by the suspect’s lawyer Peter Bore to have him released on bond on Monday. Justice Mulwa, while dismissing the request, said that it was premature as the suspect was yet to plead to the charges. The court further directed that the suspect be remanded at the Nakuru GK Prison until February 12 when the case will be mentioned.   The student is accused of murdering Peter Mogusu, a teacher at Hopewell Secondary School.
