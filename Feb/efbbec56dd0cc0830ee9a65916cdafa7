A National Treasury report tabled in the National Assembly paints a gloomy picture of the status of government projects. Projects valued at nearly Sh366 billion have stalled. But even more alarming is that a whopping Sh72.5 billion has so far been pumped into these projects with Sh293.4 billion the outstanding cost of the ventures. Parliament had demanded this report following concerns that huge amounts of money are routinely being sunk into projects that are either delayed or never completed. If the projects are not revived and completed, this will be good money down the drain. BIG FOUR The projects were being undertaken by ministries and state departments and agencies — the most affected being dams for irrigation, roads, learning institutions, crop research and construction of courtrooms, among others. Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich has blamed the crisis on the realignment of the Budget to fund President Uhuru Kenyatta’s ‘Big Four Agenda’, devolution and lack of funds. To address the situation, he proposes to prioritise spending on viable projects. Regrettably, Mr Rotich’s words affirm the fears of many Kenyans, that the conception of the projects and allocation of funds are never subjected to critical evaluation. EVALUATION It points to a shocking failure by government technocrats to undertake due diligence on projects and advise political leaders accordingly. Seemingly, they, too, got caught up in the frenzy of project launches by the politicians, hence the mess. It’s essential that these officials are fully involved in the planning, costing and execution of projects to ensure that they are properly implemented, for taxpayers to get value for their money.
