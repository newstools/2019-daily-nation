Uganda has deported MTN Chief Executive Officer Wim Vanhelleputte, a Belgian. In a letter signed by Internal Affairs Minister Jeje Odongo on Thursday, the MTN Uganda boss is to stay outside Uganda indefinitely. Police spokesman Fred Enanga on Thursday evening told the Daily Monitor that Mr Vanhelleputte had already been taken to Entebbe airport. "He's already at the airport and destined for Belgium around midnight. Over similar circumstances of national security," he said. However, he did not disclose the specific accusations levelled against the CEO. The move comes shortly after the arrest and deportation of three other senior employees at the telecommunications company— including Ms Elsa Mussolini, the MTN mobile money general manager, and Ms Annie Tabura who was the general manager for sales and distribution. On Friday, MTN Uganda’s appointed Chief Technical Officer Gordian Kyomukama as the acting CEO. In a statement, the company said it has not been notified of the grounds for Mr Vanhelleputte's deportation. “We are understandably concerned about these developments and are engaging with the authorities to seek understanding that would lead us to resolving this matter,” the telcom said. “Our focus continues to be on delivering the best quality products and services to our customers.”
