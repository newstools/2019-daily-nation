The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has summoned Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala over the alleged irregular award of a Sh100 million contract for a 2017 conference. A letter signed by the agency's investigations director, Abdi Mohamud, stated it was conducting investigations into claims of a contract award to the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) Kenya, regarding hosting the 2017 Destination Expo Conference. The ASTA Destination Expo is an international event that takes place at different locations every year, the purpose being to sell new destinations to clients, according to its website. In the letter, Mr Balala was asked to report to the EACC's headquarters at Integrity Centre in Nairobi by Monday to record a statement. The EACC told the minister, "To facilitate our investigations, you are kindly invited for an interview and statement recording at our Integrity Centre offices on February 18, 2019 at 9am." EACC officers Francis Wafula and Kimutai Langat will record the minister's statement. The Nation learnt that Tourism Principal Secretary Joe Okudo had been recording statements over the issue that has raised a storm in the ministry. Via Twitter on Friday, Mr Balala said, "[The] EACC inquiry on the American Society of Travel Agents Expo that took place at KICC in Feb 2017, organised by ASTA Kenya chapter, has been an ongoing process ... the Ministry of Tourism has fully cooperated since the start of the inquiry."   Confirmed hotel and conference hall bookings indicate 2017 will witness a hype of activity buoyed by 2016â€™s success that saw over 100 world leaders visit Kenya at different times.
