Shaphan Oyugi's ninth minute strike was all Kariobangi Sharks needed to see off hosts Kakamega Homeboyz 1-0 in a SportPesa Premier League match at Bukungu Stadium on Tuesday. The visitors were reduced to10 men by referee Andrew Juma after he issued a red card to defender Nixon Omondi for dangerous play against Solomon Amunga in the 63rd minute. After the match, Sharks coach William Muluya termed the red card issued to his player as very unfair. “The tackle was not excessive. The player did not deserve such harsh treatment,” he lamented. Homeboyz stand-in-tactician Eliud Omukuya attributed their defeat to bad luck. “The boys played well. We were dominant for the better part of the match” he noted. The match started on a high and in the fourth minute, Oyugi overstretched custodian David Juma after he was fed by Sydney Lokale to snatch the opener. A counter attack from Homeboyz forwards Moses Mudavadi, Allan Wanga and Luke Namanda proved futile as they were repulsed buy a strong backline of Sharks marshalled by defence kingpin Nixon Omondi. Referee Juma was forced to issue a yellow card to Sharks' Henry Juma for a dangerous tackle on Ali Ahmed in the 28th minute, and two minute later, Allan Wanga’s shot was parried over the cross bar by John Oyemba. Sharks led 1-0 at the breather in the match in which Homeboyz Chairman Cleophas “Toto” Shimanyula allowed fans to enter free of charge. Coach Omukuya substituted Wanga and brought in Edwin Lavatsa. Muluya pulled out striker Eric Kapaito and his place was taken up by former Kakamega High School attacker James Mazembe in the 56th minute. The second half was a see-saw affair up to the last whistle.
