Following Shabana’s recent run of poor results in the National Super League, the club’s board has suspended secretary general Mr Paul Mayieko in what they say is a bid to remedy the situation. According to a letter signed by the club chairman Jared Nivaton and organising secretary Evans Kibagendi Thursday, the suspension comes into place with immediate effect. “Note that you are advised to disassociate yourself from club activities until the club completes further investigations,” part of the letter said. “We will not seat back and assume nothing is happening while our team risks relegation,” chairman Nivaton told Nation Sport on phone. It’s alleged that Mayieko is accused of inciting players and sabotage caused by his poor leadership and lack of co-operation with other officials. Shabana, who are on a five match losing streak, play Kenya Police at Camp Toyoyo on Sunday.
