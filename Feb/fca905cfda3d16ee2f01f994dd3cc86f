There was a drama at a Mombasa hospital Thursday night after a mother staged a protest over what she termed as huge maternity bill. Phyllis Omido, a human rights activists, claimed Pandya Memorial Hospital overcharged her after she delivered her baby at the hospital. Ms Omido delivered through caesarean section earlier this week and was charged Sh293,336 for the services, according to an invoice seen by the Nation. “The money they are charging me is exaggerated. I want to understand why the doctors want me to pay so much,” said Ms Omido who camped at the hosptial’s entrance with her newly born baby most of Thursday night. The activist said she settled Sh107,336 of the bill, but had an issue with the invoice indicating that four doctors who treated her were to be paid Sh186,000. She said she did not consent to being treated by more than one doctor.   Efforts to reach hospital officials over the incident failed as phone calls went unanswered. Ms Omido hoped for the intervention of the Kenya Dentists and Practitioners Board to give guidelines on hospital charges. Ms Omido, who is an environmental activist and founder for Center of Justice, Governance and Environmental Action (CJGEA) won the Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa in 2015.
