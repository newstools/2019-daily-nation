The university education regulator has told students who are in unapproved degree programmes that it is liaising with their colleges to settle the matter. Commission for University Education (CUE) chief executive Mwenda Ntarangwi said there is no need for the students to panic. Prof Ntarangwi said that some of the programmes were not approved because the universities did not submit required documents. “Some were not submitted to CUE and in others we used feedback received from universities about their capacities. We used our standards and calculated capacities for programmes against the information the universities declared,” said Mr Ntarangwi. A report by CUE revealed that a number of bachelor’s degree courses in 26 universities have not been approved even as the placement of students comes to end on February 23. Some of the unapproved bachelor’s courses are in geography, political science, community development, counselling psychology and development and policy studies.   10,000 students could end up with useless qualifications.
