Police in Gilgil, Nakuru County, are holding a 33-year-old woman in connection to the murder of her husband. Gilgil divisional police commander Emmanuel Opuru said the couple differed on Saturday evening for undisclosed reasons. The woman then picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed the 39-year-old man in the chest, he said, adding he died moments after. “We are yet to establish what transpired but interrogations are going on,” said Mr Opuru. MARITAL STRIFE John Ali, a former councillor from Kongasis where the incident happened, said the couple quarrelled many times. “The two had a history of marital strife, with their parents called to mediate on several occasions,” Mr Ali said. He added that the two were also known for drinking alcohol and picking up fights at bars. “The murder took a tribal angle, igniting fears, before police arrived and contained the situation,” Mr Ali also said, adding a grass-thatched house was torched. Administrators were on Sunday forced to convene an impromptu meeting and warn residents against fuelling ethnic tension. “We have beefed up security in affected areas to quell the simmering tension,” said the OCPD.
