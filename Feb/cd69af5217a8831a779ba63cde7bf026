Three people were critically injured in a road accident involving a 14-seater matatu and a truck. The accident occurred on Friday morning at Giampampo area on the Meru-Nairobi highway, Tharaka-Nithi County. According to eye-witnesses, the driver of the matatu moving towards Nairobi from Meru town direction was trying to overtake another vehicle when it hit an oncoming truck. “The truck tried to avoid a head on collision with the speeding matatu,” said Ms Violet Gatwiri, an eye witness. DRIVER TRAPPED Mr James Mutegi, another witness, said they were forced to cut parts of the matatu using an axe to rescue the diver who was trapped in the wreckage. Maara OCPD Johnston Kabusia said they had launched investigations to establish the cause of the accident. He however, urged motorists to avoid speeding, especially, where road is not clear. “This section of the road between Nkubu and Chuka towns has very many corners and drivers must drive carefully,” said Mr Kabusia. SPEED BUMPS Residents urged Kenya National Highways Authority to erect speed bumps at the scene of the accident. They claimed that many people, including school children, had been killed there in the past. “No single week ends without an accident here,” said Mr Nicholas Kimathi, a boda boda rider. The injured were rushed to Chuka County Referral Hospital for treatment.
