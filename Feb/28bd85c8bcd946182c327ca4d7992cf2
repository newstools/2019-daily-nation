French President Emmanuel Macron will make a two-day State visit to Kenya mid March. French Ambassador Aline Kuster-Menager on Monday confirmed the visit when she paid President Uhuru Kenyatta a courtesy call at State House in Nairobi. President Kenyatta said he looked forward to hosting his French counterpart and that he expects the visit to break new ground in the two country's relations. “Traditionally, Kenya and France enjoy strong bilateral ties and I am pleased that we've continued to deepen the relations. I look forward to the visit by President Macron,” Mr Kenyatta said. During Mr Macron's visit, Kenya and France are expected to sign several agreements and memoranda of understanding on subjects of mutual interest. The proposed rapid transit train service, between the Nairobi central business district and the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, is among projects expected to feature prominently in their discussions.   Commuter trains are aimed at wooing the middle class to use public transport.
