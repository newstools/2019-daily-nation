Police have increasingly come under pressure in recent days over the rising incidence of killings of people in unexplained circumstances. The accusations of extrajudicial killings by some officers soil the image of the service, whose sole responsibility is to protect citizens and their property. It is, therefore, the height of irony for the very service expected to provide security to the people to be accused of carrying out such killings. It is quite encouraging that the police have not only been quick to defend themselves against the accusations, but have gone out of their way to solve the mysterious deaths. They have, nonetheless, increasingly found themselves on the receiving end with the bodies of people reported missing turning up in the mortuary. EVIDENCE One such case is that of a human rights activist in Nairobi’s Dandora, whose body was found at City Mortuary several days after she went missing. The speculation and rumours sparked by such incidents simply point to the need to speedily investigate such cases. The police should sift through the evidence they collect and let the public know what might have transpired. However, cases such as the recent killing by officers at Kibera, Nairobi, of an overseas-based Kenyan student who was back home to visit relatives but was alleged to have been a member of a gang, won’t endear the people to the security agents unless they come up with irrefutable evidence of such wrongdoing. IPOA The only saving grace is the prompt investigation of such alleged extrajudicial killings by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa). The organisation needs to speed up its enquiries and release the findings to the public. All the same, these killings and other forms of violence are proof of the need to enhance national security and assure Kenyans of their safety.
