Deputy President William Ruto has ordered the Agriculture and National Treasury ministries to buy subsidised fertiliser ahead of the planting season. He said the government has already bought a million bags of fertiliser but is still waiting for two million more. "I direct the ministries speed up the purchase of the fertiliser since the planting season is just weeks away," Dr Ruto said during the burial of Mr Leonard Kipkorir Yator in Kesses Friday. FARMERS The order came barely a week after a group in Uasin Gishu under the North Rift Farmers Union signed an agreement with the Export Trading Group to import and distribute the input. The farmers said they took the decision because the government was taking long to import the fertiliser. ETG will supply farmers with DAP fertiliser at Sh3,000 per 50kg bag. The company also agreed to buy maize from farmers at Sh1,900 per 90kg bag. Dr Ruto said there is need to have more food in the country. "We want to increase the produce from farms in order to have enough food to feed everyone. Food security is one of the Big Four Agenda," he added. OTHER CROPS At the same time, Dr Ruto challenged maize farmers to diversify. "I appeal to maize farmers to grow other crops. We will support county governments to sensitise farmers on diversification," he said. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and Caleb Kositany (Soy) and County Assembly Speaker David Kiplagat attended the burial. Until his death, Yator was a senior official in the Myoot Council of Elders. He served at the presidential escort unit until his retirement in 2000. Mr Ruto said the government is committed to universal health coverage and asked governors to support the scheme. "The government is running a pilot programme in four counties. We expect everybody to have access to healthcare by 2022," the DP added.
