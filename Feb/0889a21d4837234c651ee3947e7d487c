"Those registered for KCSE are 282,252 boys and 274,384 girls," she said. EXAM FEE The exercise, which began on January 3 and is expected to end on February 15, will cost Sh4 billion. Dr Karogo directed school heads to make sure all eligible students are registered for the exams that start in November. Last year 1.7 million candidates sat for the tests. In ensuring that no student is locked out, the government has been paying for examination fees for all students.
