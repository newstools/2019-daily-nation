A farmhand in Bomet has been convicted with murdering a photojournalist and cleric two years ago. Wilson Chepchilat aka Star was convicted by Bomet High Court judge Martin Muya of murdering  pastor John Makibior on August 13, 2017 at Kakimirai village in Bomet East-Sub County. Makibior, who worked as a cleric with the Africa Gospel Church (AGC), a photographer and editor at Radio Injili, had his throat slit, head severed and fingers chopped off in a horrific murder that shocked the South Rift region. The body of the photojournalist, which had deep cut wounds on the back and spine, was dumped at Chulchuliet River some two kilometres from his home, shortly after the murder which was committed as he prepared to go to church. “An alibi presented by the defendant does not create a substantial doubt in the mind of this court with all the 18 witnesses having placed him at the murder scene,” said Justice Muya on Monday. MURDER WEAPON Further, the judge said: “A gunny bag recovered from the accused person had a bible and a cap belonging to the deceased while DNA tests from the government chemists tabled in court clearly proved that the bloodstains in a panga recovered — which was the murder weapon — matched with the blood of the victim.” Justice Muya said the court was satisfied with the overwhelming evidence from the prosecution and the suspect’s failure to explain he came about the murder weapon. “The circumstantial evidence tabled in court clearly shows that Chepchilat murdered Makibior. He is hereby convicted accordingly. Sentencing will be on March 11, upon production of probation report,” ruled Justice Muya. The farmhand had worked for the family for seven years before committing the offense. He is said to have had breakfast with the deceased and proceeded to administer drugs to a sick cow before the murder.
