Police are investigating the death of Masinde Muliro University student whose body was found on Saturday dumped near a timber yard at Lurambi estate in Kakamega town. The body of the fourth year student had visible head injuries, said Kakamega South police boss Joseph Chebii. “We suspect our colleague was bludgeoned to death by his attackers.  We managed to identify him because of the clothes he was wearing when he left the house,” the chairman of the Masinde Muliro University Student Organisation (Mmuso) Clifton Kisera said. Mr Kisera said students have become easy targets for criminals who waylay them near their private hostels or as they walk home at night. But the police blamed the students for exposing themselves to criminals by loitering at night even though Kakamega town aspires to be a 24-hour economy. “We are doing our best to ensure there is adequate security in residential estates within Kakamega town and the rest of the sub-county. But our officers will continue making arrests of students found loitering in town at night while drunk,” said Mr Chebii. Last week, an armed robber injured a guard at the home of a lecturer Koromatang estate.   Mourners ask the government to ensure trigger-happy police officers are punished.
