Elders from three larger Ogaden communities living in Garissa have endorsed the re-election of Sheikh Ahmed Islam Madobe as the President of Jubaland. Sheikh Madobe has been meeting politicians and elders in Garissa County ahead of the polls in the semi-autonomous region of Somalia. He has held talks with elders from Awilyahan, Abduwak and Abdalla as he seeks consolidate support from his Ogaden people, majority of whom residing in Kenya. Elders including Dekow Muhumed Dualle, Osman Ibrahim Abdi and Ahmed Dualle Kuriyow said on Friday that they support Mr Madobeâ€™s re-election mainly because of the peace enjoyed since it was liberated from Al-Shabaab in 2012. Jubaland's capital, Kismayu, which was captured by the Kenya Defence Forces, stretches along the entire Kenyan border, effectively creating a buffer zone with the rest of Somalia. The elders made their announcement following a meeting at a Garissa hotel. Mr Madobe visited Garissa in December and since there was no official communication about this, there was speculation as to why he came calling. The secret meeting sought to urge the local Kenyan leaders to support his re-election.   Dignitaries including Foreign Affairs CS attend the inauguration.
