Francis Ochola’s ninth minute goal was all that Modern Coast Rangers needed to beat Coast Stima in a National Super League match played on Saturday at Serani Sports Ground. Ochola slammed home from close range after Stima defender Alfred Mwangi had failed to clear the danger. The goal proved to be the difference in this tension-packed clash pitting two Mombasa teams gunning for promotion into SportPesa Premier League. Stima put up spirited fight in the first half with Davis Shikala, Joshua Oyoo and Collins Kombo all coming close to restoring parity but their shots missed the target. A delighted Rangers coach Joseph Shihuli was confident that his charges will maintain the momentum going into next matches. “I’m happy that after the team’s poor start, we’ve started climbing up the league ladder and I hope we’ll continue winning our future matches,” he said. His Stima counterpart Joseph Oyoo commended his players for the fighting spirit. “I’m saddened by the result of the match which we deserved to win or at least sharing the points,” he said.
