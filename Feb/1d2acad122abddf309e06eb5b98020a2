Human rights lawyer Harun Ndubi was arrested on Sunday on allegations of drink-driving and causing an accident. Nairobi area traffic police officers apprehended the senior lawyer and took him to Kilimani Police Station, a source at the Traffic Police Headquarters told the Nation. Mr Ndubi was arrested in February 2018 for driving while drunk but human rights activists claimed he was drugged and arrested while in critical condition. Activist Alamin Kimathi tweeted that he was drugged near State House and that police apprehended him “instead of taking him to hospital”. The then Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome denied the claim that he was drugged. "He parked the vehicle in the middle of the road…he slept in the vehicle…[he was] very drunk,” Mr Koome said. “He was arrested. He is in custody, and he is going to court this morning for driving under the influence of alcohol.”   Police says he was driving while drunk, but activists say he was drugged.
