The Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) has suspended permits of two more firms whose peanut butter brands have also been found to have exceeded the maximum aflatoxin content, alongside ordering the recall of Jetlak Foods Limited’s Nuteez product. The agency says food manufacturers Triclover — producer of Clovers Nuts Smooth and Clovers Nuts Chocolate brands — and Mother’s Nature have been instructed to discontinue the production or sale of substandard peanut butter. This means the three companies can no longer use the Kebs standardisation mark to label their food brands. “Additionally, the manufacturers should recall all the substandard products and institute corrective actions,” reads Kebs’ statement in part. In the notice issued Monday, the Kebs said Triclover and Mother’s Nature had exceeded the maximum total aflatoxin content, which is 15 parts per billion (ppb). Clovers Nuts Smooth had aflatoxin level of 36.44 ppb, Clovers Nuts Chocolate hit 44.25 ppb while Mother Nature’s level of aflatoxin was 27.26 ppb. The agency said it had undertaken inspection of Jetlak Foods Limited’s premises, the Ruiru-based manufacturer of Nuteez, and took samples that confirmed the level of aflatoxin to be 25.13 ppb. The latest results are slightly higher than the initial samples taken by public health officers in Nandi County, which had found aflatoxin contamination of up to 24.08 ppb. “Consequently, the Kebs has also suspended the permit to the company that allows it to use the standardisation mark for its Nuteez brand and the firm directed to recall all the products in the market.”   Government Chemist confirms presence of aflatoxin in Nuteez peanut butter.
