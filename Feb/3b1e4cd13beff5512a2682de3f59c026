Police in Makueni County confiscated bhang with a street value of more than Sh3 million in Emali town on Sunday. They found the 6,180 rolls of bhang stuffed in sacks in a private car whose occupants abandoned it when they realised officers on patrol were following them. None of the people, said to have been transporting the bhang to Mombasa County were apprehended as they fled on foot. A search was launched.   Makueni Police Commander Joseph Napeiyan said, "We collected a mobile phone from the car and will use it, alongside the registration details, to track those who were in it." The vehicle was towed to the Emali Police Station yard and samples taken to the Government Chemist for testing. "Once it is confirmed to be bang we shall head to court for directions," the police commander said.    Researchers say active ingredient in bhang could alter sperms.
