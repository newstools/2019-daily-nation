Five more NTSA officials have been presented before a Nairobi court over accusations of aiding terrorists who attacked Dusit hotel complex last month. The five are accused of being involved in a racket for making fake motor vehicle plates. The police believe that they aided the attackers by issuing fake number plates to the attackers. SUSPECTS Anthony Kadu, Jacqueline Githinji, Cosmas Ngeso, Irving Irungu, Stephen Kariuki and Charles Ndung'u were presented before Senior Resident Magistrate Caroline Nzibe on Friday. The prosecution led by Duncan Ondimu asked to be allowed to detain the suspects for 30 days, as they conduct investigations. Another NTSA official Mr Augustine Mulwa Musembi was presented in court on Wednesday and police were allowed to hold him for one month. The Toyota Ractis, registration number KCN 240E, was used by the four attackers who staged a terror at the hotel on January 15 killing 21 people. It later emerged that there was a different car with similar registration in Kitengela, Kajiado County. Police said that one of the number plates is either fake or was issued fraudulently. Mr Musembi is suspected to have aided in issuance of the registration while Mr Kadu is alleged to directed him to reissue the number plate to the vehicle used by the terrorists. The police said they need time to visit NTSA offices and investigate the procurement process and recover all the documents related to the production of the duplicate number plates. "It is necessary for investigators to find out the process of production of number plates generally and specifically the production of both sets of the number plates in the issue," the application reads. The court will make a ruling at 2.30pm.   Anti-terrorism police suspect he might have aided those who attacked DusitD2 Hotel complex.
