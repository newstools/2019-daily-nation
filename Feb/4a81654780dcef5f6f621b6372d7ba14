Former Gor Mahia fullback Tobias Ocholla alias Jua Kali has urged the record Kenyan champions to be fearless against Zamalek of Egypt in the opening group game of the Caf Confederation Cup on Sunday evening at Kasarani stadium. Ocholla, who was in the Gor squad that played against the White Knights in the same competition in 1994 under the tutelage of Austin Oduor, admitted a lot has changed between the two teams but that should not be cause for alarm. “If we don’t focus well it can be a big disappointment but the consolation is that we are all playing in the same competition hence are at par with each other despite the differences between the two sides in terms of achievements and professionalism,” the 56-year-old Ocholla told Nation Sport on Saturday. He added: “We are going into this match as underdogs thus should use the first 15 minutes to study our opponents because they also don’t know us well, "If we can’t pick three points, let’s come out with a point to begin well in this group stages, this time we have to show to the entire Africa what we are capable of,” he concluded. Ocholla joined Gor Mahia in February 1986 from Kisumu HotStars. He was signed by English coach Len Juliens and went ahead to don the green jersey until 1996. He played for Harambee Stars from 1987 to 1994.
