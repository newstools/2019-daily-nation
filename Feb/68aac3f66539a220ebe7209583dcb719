Embattled Migori Governor Okoth Obado wants a review of his strict bail terms in case he is charged with murdering his girlfriend Sharon Otieno and her unborn child. Mr Obado filed the application on Thursday requesting Justice Jessie Lesiit to not only return his passport but also let him travel through Homa Bay County, which he was banned from visiting since Sharonâ€™s parents and potential witnesses live there. The governor said the shorter route to Nairobi passes through court-restricted areas and the alternative path is costly and longer. Mr Obado said he cannot access all the eight constituencies in Migori County, because some are within the restricted zone. BAIL TERMS The High Court issued tough conditions for his release from police custody last year, including a 20-km radius restriction in his Migori home. Justice Lesiit also ordered him to surrender his passport and seek permission before travelling abroad. The governor said he chairs the Council of Governors' agriculture team which may require him to attend international forums. Mr Obado made the rquests when he appeared before Justice Lesiit for the mention of his murder case. He is charged together with his former personal assistant Michael Oyamo and Migori County clerk Caspal Obiero. The state prosecutor Alexander Muteti told the court that they have supplied 10 statements to the defence team and eight are still remaining. The case will be mentioned on March 20 for pretrial.   The lawmakers claimed that the Judiciary is not helping to effectively prosecute suspects.
