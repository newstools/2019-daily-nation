With five games remaining to the completion of their National Super League first leg fixtures, Shabana return home to Gusii Stadium on Sunday to take on Kakamega High School’s Green Commandos from 4pm. The facility in Kisii town, that hosted last year’s Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association Games (KICOSCA), was initially set to be closed for one month of renovations but these have now been suspended for the team to use the facility. Kisii County authorities announced the immediate closure of the facility a month ago forcing Shabana to shift their home matches to Awendo Stadium in Migori and Camp Toyoyo in Nairobi, the latter being 307.5km from Kisii town. Against Commandos, the ‘Glamour Boys’, who currently lie ninth on the log, will be looking for their seventh win after losing 2-1 away to Fortune Sacco on Wednesday in Thika. Unbeaten Nairobi Stima will be at home in Naivasha to face Migori Youth at Karuturi Stadium in another tricky afternoon fixture, as FC Talanta host struggling Kangemi All Stars at Camp Toyoyo. Fresh from their 2-1 triumph over Shabana, eighth-placed Fortune Sacco travel to Eldoret to take on a determined Eldoret Youth at Eldoret Show ground while St Joseph Youth entertain Nairobi City Stars at Afraha Stadium. Leaders, Wazito who trounced Commandos 4-0 in their midweek match away in Kakamega to open a three point gap at the top, will visit Thika United on Monday.
