RIO DE JANEIRO Knocked out of the Copa Sudamericana at home, Brazilian club Chapecoense was comforted by fans of victorious Union La Calera of Chile who cleaned the bathrooms reserved for away fans. "Reasons to believe," tweeted Chapecoense, along with photos of spotless terracing and sparkling urinals. "Yesterday, after the match, Union La Calera fans gathered all the garbage from the south stand and cleaned the toilets they used," the tweet continued. "A great attitude that leaves us filled with gratitude!" The match ended 1-1 and the Chileans advanced on away goals because the first leg had been goalless. The Union La Calera fans also sang chants in homage to the Brazilian club whose team was wiped out by an air disaster on their way to play in the final of the same competition in Colombia in November 2016. The crash killed 71 people, including 19 players. Last week, Argentine club Talleres cleaned up the visiting dressing room at the Morumbi stadium after eliminating home team Sao Paulo in the Copa Libertadores. Talleres then tweeted a photo saying they were "continuing their good habits" and "leaving the dressing room in the same good condition as when they arrived." At the World Cup in Russia last summer Japanese fans attracted favourable attention by clearing up the stands they had occupied after games.
