Police arrested a doctor in Meru on allegations of raping a 26-year-old woman. Police on Wednesday seized the doctor at around 5pm as he left his private clinic in Makutano, Imenti Central. The woman had recorded a statement claiming that the doctor, who is in his mid-30s, beat her up before raping her in his home on Saturday last week. “I told him that I did not feel safe but he forced me to his place since I was in his car. I was vulnerable since he owed me money, which I wanted him to repay. He had also broken my two phones,” she said. WITNESSES When she declined to get into the house, the doctor allegedly threw her to the ground and started beating her up, while two of his friends watched. “He said he would rape me and no one would believe me because they have been seeing us together and they will not figure out how a boyfriend can rape his girlfriend. He said his friends would also testify against me.” She suffered lacerations in the mouth and severe bruises on the hands, head and legs. The woman said she was in a two-month romantic relationship with the doctor but terminated it after he became abusive.
