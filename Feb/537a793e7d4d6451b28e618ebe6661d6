World 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri was in a class of her own as she obliterated the field to win the National Cross Country Championships women's 10km title at the Eldoret Sports Club in Eldoret on Saturday. South Rift's Beatrice Mutai was second while World 3,000m steeplechase record holder Beatrice Chepkoech finished third.       Obiri won in 33:14.9 while Mutai clocked 33:24.3 before Chepkoech sealed the podium places in 33:54.7. Obiri ran a brilliant race behind Beatrice Mutai from South Rift and Lilian Kasait in the first two laps. In the third lap, Obiri took control of the race, opening a gap of up to 20 metres ahead of Mutai. The athlete said that she was happy to have won the race. "I really trained hard for the race and I will be going to work hard on the remaining part of training so that I can go for the only title that I'm missing," said Obiri. Obiri will be eyeing to win the title in the World Cross Country Championships next month in Denmark. Mutai said that she knew the field would competitive, that's why she decided to run from the front. "I'm happy I managed to get a slot in Team Kenya for the global event," said Mutai. Chepkoech said that she was happy to make the senior team being her first time to participate in 10km. "I have never participated in the 10km cross country and I'm happy with my performance today. I will be working hard in the remaining days to sharpen my skills," said Chepkoech. The team will head to Kigari Teachers Training College for residential training ahead of the World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark on March 30.   Kamworor is likely to get a wild card to the event in Denmark.
