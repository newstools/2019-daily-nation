A section of Mombasa-Nairobi highway near Kibwezi town has been temporarily closed as wildlife rangers herd stray elephants back to the Chyulu National Park. The elephants, suspected to be two, strayed into farmlands at Manyanga. Kenya Wildlife Service rangers are using a helicopter to push back the elephants. Police officers closed the road to stop motorists from running into the elephants.
