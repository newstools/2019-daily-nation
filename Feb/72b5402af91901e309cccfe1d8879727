One area where the public universities continue to perform dismally is in the handling of their own examinations. This is ironical, as exams are the best measure of the performance of the students and determine their qualifications. Unlike in the old days, when the teaching and marking of examinations went like clockwork in the institutions, today, many students spend a lot of time chasing for their marks to be tallied and some end up not graduating at all. Part of the explanation is that there are too many universities and students for the lecturers to handle. This is a lame excuse that should never be condoned. The saga of missing marks undermines the reputation of institutions that should be citadels of learning and centres of academic excellence. On Monday morning, students of Moi University’s  main campus protested at not getting their marks for various semesters. The most affected are second and fourth-year students. This raises the question as to how the students were allowed to continue from one year to next without results. Shouldn’t promotion to the next year be based on performance in exams? So, how do the universities decide who sits supplementary exams and who does not? Or don’t they have these exams anymore? It gets quite ridiculous when parents have to go to the campuses to demand that their children’s results be released so they can graduate. One explanation often heard is that some part-time lecturers, having gone without pay for years, just disappear without handing in some of the results. Whatever the case, this is a serious crisis that the universities and the Education ministry must urgently tackle to restore confidence in university education.
