The phenomenal Dennis Oliech dedicated his debut goal in Caf Confederation Cup to his late brother Steve Okumu, the last Kenyan to score against Zamalek. Oliech came in after 67 minutes for an injured Nicholas Kipkurui, another scorer on the day, and got his first goal in continental club football. Okumu's lone strike helped Gor Mahia overcome Zamalek in a Caf Cup tie played at the same venue in 1998. “I dedicate this goal to the late Stephen Okumu,” remarked Oliech who wriggled through Zamalek defenders before rounding goalkeeper Mahmoud Ahmed to slot into an empty net at the death. “I knew I would score by employing the same style and celebrating in the same manner like he did, I am happy for myself, the fans and Gor Mahia,” added the 33-year-old. Oliech's late strike was the icing on the cake as Gor Mahia eventually ran out 4-2 victors against a much fancied Zamalek in the first round of matches in Pool D. Jacques Tuyisenge, the captain of the day, scored a brace to send K'Ogalo on top of the tough pool that has also Hussein Dey (Algeria) and Petro Atletico (Angola) . Oliech believes that his experience across the globe can inspire K’Ogalo to better tiding this season. “This game is done now focus shifts to the league fixtures, we need to retain the title. This kind of experience I believe will help me, it already did today so I hope we can keep working for a better tomorrow,” he concluded.
