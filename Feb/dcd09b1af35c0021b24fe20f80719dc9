Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata's mother, Margaret Wangechi Irungu, has died from diabetes and hypertension. The senator confirmed this when the Nation contacted him on Saturday. The mother of seven had been undergoing treatment at Coptic Hospital in Nairobi where she died in the morning. Murang’a leaders including Kiharu's Ndindi Nyoro and nominated MP Maina Kamanda sent condolence messages to Mr Kang'ata, who is also the Senate Deputy Chief Whip. “We have lost an exemplary mother who was selfless. Her humility was exhibited by the way she lived. Kiharu is mourning,” Mr Nyoro said. Kigumo MP Ruth Mwaniki termed the death a blow to the county. “I was with the senator on Friday when I wished his mother quick recovery, not knowing she would leave us today. I [went] through the same journey last year. The senator’s case is extreme because both his parents were at the hospital. May she rest in eternal peace," she said.
