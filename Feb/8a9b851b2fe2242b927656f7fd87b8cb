Dear Brenda, I had an affair with one of my colleagues and she gave birth to a baby girl. My wife found out soon after the child was born and confronted me. I admitted the affair and after a lengthy conversation, I assured my wife that the relationship with my girlfriend was over. She forgave me and threatened to leave if I cheated on her again. However, I continued to see my girlfriend behind my wifeâ€™s back. Now, my girlfriend recently gave birth to a baby boy. Should I confess my continued affair to my wife? I have been supporting this other woman for eight years now, she knows I am married and has no problem with that. But my wife, I am afraid of hurting her or worse, losing her and the three children we have together. Please advise.  This is a problem with many facets but the main one here seems to be that you continue to be dishonest with your wife. The first kid she was gracious enough to forgive, but I doubt she will be as kind with the second one. You have to tell her. You continued to lie to your wife and see your girlfriend, and your choices are catching up with you. This is something you have to come clean with, regardless of the consequences - you can't hide a whole child, and your wife found out about the last time. I guarantee that she will be more upset that you hid it from her if you don't tell her. You owe her at least this final courtesy. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   The idea of being alone really stresses me out.
