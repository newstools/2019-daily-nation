Brian Awathi recovered and netted the first goal for the visitors on 20 minutes heading in a well curved corner from Vitalis Akumu. Ndolo who was at it again on 43 minutes, scoring his third for his first hat-trick at the club. Lihanga Castro scored the second goal for the visitors just before the break after a fine counter attack as the two sides took a 3-2 scoreline to the break. Three minutes upon resumption, Onyancha scored the fourth goal for the Gilbert Selebwa coached side and added another on the hour mark for a brace. Former Kenyan international Bob Mugalia netted the sixth goal as the Kisii side cruised with delightful passes in the visitor’s territory. In the 90th minute, Daniel Murage sealed the emphatic win beating Green Commandos goalkeeper Maxwell Muchesia with a fine strike. “We have been very inconsistent in our matches having lost six and won three in our last nine matches something that we have resolved to work on,” Shabana assistant coach Andrew Kanuli said after the match. Kanuli is currently in charge of Shabana as head coach Gilbert Selebwa serves his suspension and he emphasises that the side is focused on winning the NSL title and earning promotion to the SportPesa Premier League.
