A businessman whose wife was fatally shot at City Park in May last year told a judge he did not leave his house in Donholm, Nairobi after hearing that she had been killed. Mr George Kirubi told Justice Stella Mutuku that he last saw Ms Janet Waiyaki on May 18, 2018 before leaving for a burial in Murang’a, the following day. Upon return, he, other relatives and some friends proceeded to a restaurant in Pangani where they took drinks until a few minutes past midnight when he went to sleep at his first wife's house which was the restaurant. The witness told court that the following morning he proceeded to Donholm but did not find his wife- Ms Waiyaki- at home. “I was told by the house girl that she had left. I called her but she was not pick up her phone,” he said. Asked whether their marriage was facing trouble, Mr Kirubi admitted saying “normal marriage hiccups but we always solved them”. The witness denied claims of an affair between his wife and a nephew, Bernard Chege, who survived the shooting. He said he later found out that Ms Waiyaki was with Mr Chege when they were shot and that his nephew had been admitted at Intensive Care Unit. He said he was first called by his sister in-law, informing him that Ms Waiyaki had been shot at City Park and rushed to Avenue Park Hospital. SUSPECTS Mr William Chirchir, an Administration Police officer from Makadara Police Station and Mr Godfrey Kirui from Industrial Area have denied murdering the businesswoman on May 20, 2018 at City Park. The two officers are out on bond. On Tuesday, Mr Kirubi said he was married to Ms Waiyaki for about 16 years and they had three children. He said they jointly operated a hotel and a mobile phones shop at the junction of Tom Mboya and Ronald Ngala Street.   Survivor denies claims that they were in a compromising situation.
