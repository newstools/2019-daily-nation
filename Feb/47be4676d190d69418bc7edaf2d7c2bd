Vigurungani Secondary School will be the team to watch in boys’ and girls’ basketball when the Kwale County Term One games get underway at Matuga Girls High School on Thursday morning. The little known Kinango sub county-based school has vowed to upset the form book and power their way into the regional games for the first time ever, as they look to brush aside opposition from favourites Kaya Tiwi and Shimba Hills. Head coach Kahindi Mwema said the team has been in rigorous training under his watchful eye and warned his group A opponents Lunga Lunga Secondary of Msambweni, Matuga Girls of Matuga, and Mivumo to brace for a real fight. “I have a very strong team in Christine Chiziga, Riziki Jillo and Nemburus Ingoi, who have been the teams backbone and with the support the team has been receiving from our new principal Kifuso Mwambegu, the sky should be the limit," Mwema said. Group B of the girls’ basketball competition has defending champions Kaya Tiwi, Kingwede Secondary, Perani Secondary and Mazeras Girls. In the absence of boys' defending champions Kaya Tiwi, Shimba Hills Secondary will battle it out with Mazeras Boys and Lunga Lunga in group C, while group A has Mivumoni Secondary, Kinango Secondary, Kwale High and Taru Secondary. Vigurungani Boys are in group B, which also has Perani Secondary and Gombato Secondary. Other games on show will be hockey, handball as well as rugby sevens and 15s. Coast region will host the Term One National Games in April.
