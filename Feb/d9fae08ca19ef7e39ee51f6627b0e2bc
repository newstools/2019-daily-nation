A man accused of impersonating Deputy President William Ruto’s wife will remain in police custody for three more days for police to finish their investigations. In a ruling on Monday, magistrate Muthoni Nzibe allowed police to continue holding Michael Mito Atito pending the completion of the probe into claims he opened a social media account using Rachel Ruto’s name and photograph. According to Chief Inspector George Chai, the suspect said on the Facebook account that he was supporting the less fortunate by giving free lorries. Mr Chai said that Mr Atito and accomplices who were not in court also asked unsuspecting members of the public for money to register the vehicles in their names. “It has been proven on oath that for the purpose of an investigation into the commission of an offence, it is necessary [for you to be] remanded at Central Police Station for three days,” Ms Nzibe told the accused. SCRUTINY Police said they needed to record statements from key witnesses who live in Kisumu where the suspect was arrested. They also intend to obtain the suspect's M-Pesa account records in order to check his transactions as well as contact victims of the scam. Police further want Mr Atito subjected to an identification parade. The suspect is yet to be charged but the court heard that he was being investigated for impersonation contrary to Section 15 of the Penal code. He will be arraigned on February 11.
