Hi Brenda, Recently, my man started snoring very loudly in his sleep. I have tried sleeping in the living room which is about three metres from the bedroom, but I still hear him snore. Every morning I wake up exhausted because I hardly sleep. The situation is unbearable. How do I address this issue without hurting his feelings?  Hi, You are going to have to hurt his feelings. I'm sorry. A lack of sleep is very detrimental to you, causing an obvious lack of functionality, irritation, and inefficiency in your daily life. You said he recently started, which means this could be a number of solvable problems: a sinus issue, a sleeping position issue, a mattress issue, etc. You need to go see a specialist, lest this is something more serious and medical. He might need something pulled out or cut out. In this instance, I don't think earplugs will do the trick. Whatever method you use to stop his snoring or make it stop affecting you is definitely going to make him feel some type of way, but you simply have to do it. You have no choice. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   Everything was okay until the day she conceived.
