Kenya Wildlife Service officers Saturday recovered a body of a man killed by a crocodile at Oele Beach in Bondo. The body of Kennedy Ouma, who was killed by a crocodile in Lake Victoria four days ago, was found by the officers who had been looking for him since Tuesday night when he was reported missing. Fishermen had on the night of the incident recovered Mr Ouma’s clothes and fishing gear at a spot where crocodiles had been sighted. Mr William Opondo, Oele Beach Management Unit Chairman told the Nation that the 32-year-old went on a fishing expedition but never returned. “Mr Ouma was alone when he went fishing in the lake despite the fact that a crocodile had been seen in that area earlier in the day,” said Mr Opondo. In the recent past, there has been many cases of animal attacks, raising concern over the safety of residents near the lake. Mr Francis Otiato, Yimbo East MCA, called on the KWS to ensure the victims are compensated. “We are losing our people to wildlife and nobody has ever been compensated for the losses,” said Otiato.
