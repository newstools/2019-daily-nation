Daystar University has appointed Prof Laban Ayiro as the vice chancellor effective from March 1. The university's council chairman, Prof Henry Thairu, confirmed the appointment. "The appointment of Prof Ayiro follows a rigorous process which started on December 5, 2018. In January 2019, the council received six potential candidates from a total of 30 applicants interviewed by the human resource consultant, Manpower Limited," he said on Friday. He added that Prof Ayiro will be taken through a one-month induction by Prof James Kombo, who was holding the post in acting capacity since June last year. Prof Ayiro headed Moi University on acting basis from September 2016 to March 2018. Before his elevation at Moi, he was the acting deputy vice chancellor in charge of planning. CHAOS The position at Daystar University became vacant after Prof Timothy Wachira was dismissed following chaos by students last year. Police officers were sent in to quell the situation. Student leaders accused Prof Wachira of mismanagement, lack of transparency and poor leadership. The unrest forced the institution's Senate to close the Athi River and Nairobi campuses. "Many programmes lack adequate facilities yet the university has sunk Sh40 million into the establishment of a law school, which to date has not admitted a single student," a student said, calling for his resignation. Daystar University Students Association, Senior Staff Association of Daystar University and Daystar University General Staff Association wrote to the university council demanding a comprehensive financial audit.   Staff members have also complained of delayed salaries and lack of morale.
