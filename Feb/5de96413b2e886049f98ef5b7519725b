Trans-Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has moved embattled Health executive Christine Tanguli to the Lands docket after MCAs threatened to impeach her over alleged incompetence. Ms Tanguli was under pressure to quit after a section of residents took to the streets over deteriorating health services in the county. The health executive has been replaced by Ms Claire Namenge Sifuna who has been moved from the Public Service Management docket. Ms Susan Nelima replaces Mrs Sifuna at the Lands department. SERVICE DELIVERY In other changes, the governor also swapped two Chief Officers. Ms Lineka Nafula Bwire replaced Dr Robert Masinde at the public service department with the latter taking over Education and ICT docket. Mr Sifuna Wakofula, the County Secretary, told the Nation that the changes sought to improve service delivery. "We have notified the county assembly of these changes and it's about improving service delivery,” he said. He, however, dismissed claims that the move was meant to save Ms Tanguli from being sacked. SACKED "These are normal changes. If the assembly is planning to impeach one of the CeC then it is upon them,” he explained. Kaplamai Ward Representative Elkana Kagunda had filed a notice of motion to impeach Ms Tanguli over alleged gross mismanagement of the health sector. The motion is set for debate this week. The MCA cited gross violation of law and gross misconduct as grounds for her impeachment. He also accused the Ms Tanguli of violating the 2010 Constitution by dismissing recommendations from the county assembly health committee by transferring heads of various county hospitals.   Patrick Khaemba says cartels have siphoned millions of shillings from the health sector.
