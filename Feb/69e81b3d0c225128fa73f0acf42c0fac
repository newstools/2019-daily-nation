Two police officers who allegedly shot dead a 17-year-old boy at Mariakani in Kilifi County claiming they were on a mission to recover a stolen truck have finally been charged with murder. Mr Simon Oyoo and Mr Amos Kiptoo, who are attached to Mariakani Police Station, are accused of killing Kazungu Katana who was helping to push a vehicle stuck in mud after a heavy downpour on June 26, 2018. On Tuesday, the two suspects presented themselves before Malindi Resident Judge Weldon Korir for a mention after a warrant of arrest was issued against them. MENTAL TEST Justice Korir remanded them at Malindi Police Station pending their plea taking set for Thursday. The prosecution counsel Babra Zombo had asked the court to allow the suspects to be detained at the police station to enable them undergo a mental test. “This will enable the investigation officer escort them to Malindi Sub County Hospital for preparation of mental assessment report which shall be availed in court in the next two days,” she said. Meanwhile, Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) rapid response officer Francis Auma, Kaya Fungo MCA Alfonse Baya and Mr Dickson Shaban (nominated) called upon speedy prosecution of suspects. Speaking outside Malindi courts, Mr Auma said the death has negatively affected the victims’ friends, relatives and family social life. “We want justice to prevail, these extrajudicial killings must stop,” added Mr Mwayaa.
