Kanu Youth Congress chairman and Mathare community mobiliser Billian Ojiwa, who has been missing since Sunday, has been found alive. His wife Nerima Wako, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said Mr Ojiwa had been found safe. Mrs Ojiwa, the CEO of Siasa Place and a columnist with The East African, shared the good news on her Facebook page. “We found Billian thank you so much,” she wrote. Later, she confirmed the same to the Nation in an SMS: “Yes, he has been found. He is well. He is safe.” Mr Joseph Towett, the Kanu national executive director had earlier said: “The information we have is that Billian is in touch with the family members and the same has been reported to the police and therefore we’d give police time to find out the circumstances that came out of that social media circulation.” Mr Ojiwa is said to have told his friends that he went to the Retreat Centre in Karen to “cool off”. The politician, who unsuccessfully ran for the Mathare parliamentary seat in 2013, is best known for the Ficha Uchi Initiative, a programme he founded that gives school uniforms to needy children. Earlier, his wife told the Nation that she was with him at her parent’s house on Sunday when he stepped out at around noon. Additional report by Amina Wako.
