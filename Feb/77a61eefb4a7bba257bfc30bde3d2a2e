A 70-year-old woman has been lynched in Magongoni village, Kwale County, on suspicion that she was practising witchcraft. County Commissioner Karuku Ngumo said Ms Nyamvula Tsuma was hacked to death in Kinango sub county on Thursday morning. He said the deceased, who sustained deep machete cuts on the head, died on the spot during the 4am incident. “Police visited the scene and established that two assailants entered her house, pulled her out and slashed her with machetes several times," Mr Ngumo said. SUSPECTED WITCHES He condemned the attacks on suspected witches, saying they were fuelled by mistrust and baseless suspicions. He appealed to the public to give information concerning the murder to enable the police arrest the suspects. He also called on human rights organisations to join the government in creating awareness on rights of the elderly in the county. 42 PEOPLE EXECUTED “The attacks on the elderly in the county are embarrassing, elected leaders and the church should help in eradicating the menace" he said. Last year, at least 42 elderly people were executed in the county on suspicion of practicing witchcraft. Ms Tsuma’s body was moved to Kinango Sub-County Hospital mortuary.   The body of an elderly man was found hanging on a tree at the weekend.
