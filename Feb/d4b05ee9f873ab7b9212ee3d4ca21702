Hello Brenda, I don’t like Valentine’s Day but my partner really looks forward to it. I am scared of it every year. And this year is worse because of the financial constraint.  Hi, You don't have to do anything for Valentines if you don't want to. After all, Valentines is just another invention by modern man to take money out of your pocket, if we're being honest. And as we continue to be honest, if Valentines is the only day that you can truly show someone love, then you have a bigger problem than how to celebrate on Valentines. Surely your partner already knows you love them? If they don't, make sure you tell them on more than just the one day of the year. And if you don't have money, you don't have money. I hope they don't expect you to take loans so that they can have Instagram pictures. Explain to your partner that this is a bad month. If they love you too, they should understand. Alternately, find something else that's cost-effective, that won't break the bank, but is still meaningful. Like a heartfelt love letter on beautiful stationery, or a simple coffee at the restaurant where you had your first date. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I am afraid of hurting her or worse, losing her and the three children we have together.
