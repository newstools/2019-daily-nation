Hi Brenda, Valentine’s is just around the corner and I don’t have a date. Most of my friends are either married or dating so I’m the oddball without a date or prospects...and it makes me feel so bad. I’m thinking of approaching a guy I like and asking him to be my Valentine’s this time because the idea of being alone really stresses me out.  Hi, I think this is an excellent idea. In this 2019 with the ‘new year new you’ resolution wave, I fully support having someone around to witness your newness. If you don't like something about the state of your singlehood, you have the power to do something about it – particularly if you've even already identified a candidate. Good job on forward thinking. Ask him early so that he doesn't have time to make other plans with someone else who is eyeing him – and, if he refuses this Valentine’s, there's always next week or next month. Don't give up on searching for something you truly want. If all fails on Valentine's, reward your courage with a personal treat like a large tub of ice cream, yes? Or celery, if you're vegan... *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I'm supporting her throughout the pregnancy, but moving in makes me uncomfortable.
