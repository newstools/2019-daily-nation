Suspected Gaza criminal gang members have killed a 65-year old ex-Kenya Defence Forces officer in Mukuyu market, Murang’a County. Mr Samson Kamau is said to have left his home at around 4pm on Wednesday to Mukuyu, only for his wife to receive news that he had been killed by the notorious gang. Ms Margret Wambui said she had pleaded with her husband to return home early due to insecurity in the area. She said her husband was attacked and killed by a gang of five as he waited for a boda boda rider to take him home. Reports indicate that the gang took Sh60 from Mr Kamau before stabbing him to death. “One member of the gang was arrested while four escaped," Mrs Kamau said. HAMMERS AND KNIVES The suspect, who named his accomplices, narrated how they terrorised locals while armed with hammers and knives. Ms Jane Wairimu, Mr Kamau’s daughter, said the gang had taken over Mukuyu, Mjini, Mumbi and Maragi villages where they robbed, maimed and stole from innocent residents and business people. "Last year, the gang followed my husband to our home and robbed him of a mobile phone and money before beating him and leaving him for dead,” said Ms Wairimu. She added: “Not even my pleas could stop them, they threatened to kill us if we raised alarm." LACK OF EVIDENCE Last year, 12 members of the criminal gang were charged in court for being members of an outlawed group. They were eventually released by a Murang’a court for lack of evidence. Murang'a County Police Commander Mohammed Farah said they had arrested one suspect in connection with the murder and were pursuing others. “We have arrested one suspect and we are pursuing others, we urge locals to help us," he told the Nation. He said despite the police’s efforts to wipe out the criminal gang, the suspects were always released by the court.
