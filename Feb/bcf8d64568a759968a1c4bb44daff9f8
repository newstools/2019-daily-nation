Nine people died on Friday after a matatu and an oil tanker collided on the Kericho-Nakuru highway. The crash occurred at Chepsir trading centre at around 6pm. Kericho OCPD Justus Kitetu said the truck ferrying gas from Kisumu to Nakuru was using the wrong lane. "It is unfortunate that the truck was descending using a climbing lane when the accident occurred," he said, adding that the truck driver was arrested. The matatu owned by South Rift Sacco had 12 occupants. The injured are being treated at Kericho County Referral Hospital.
