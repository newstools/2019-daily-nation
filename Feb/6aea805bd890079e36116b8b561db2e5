A parliamentary committee on Tuesday sent away Transport Principal Secretary Esther Koimet and Kenya Airways chief executive Sebastian Mikosz for failing to provide the proposal that contains details of the JKIA takeover. The National Assembly Transport committee invited PS Koimet, Mr Mikosz and Kenya Airports Authority Managing Director Jonny Anderson for discussions on KQ's plan to take over the operations of the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. Members of parliament were to be provided with the Privately Initiated Investment Proposal (PIIP) on the plan but Ms Koimet said she did not have it. The MPs insisted they could not carry on without the proposal. "What business will we doing here if you don't have the proposal? We cant talk about what we haven't seen," said committee chair David Pkosing. MACHARIA ROLE Both Mr Koimet and the Kenya Airways CEO were given one hour to table the document and return with Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia. The MPs said CS Macharia was best-placed to answer their questions on the takeover since the decision was made at Cabinet level. "The CS is at the centre of this so we cannot proceed without him. He has to be here," said Shadrack Mose of Kitutu Masaba. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria said, "This is not a document that you're going to manufacture. It is on your shelf ... just go and pick it for us." The committee adjourned for one hour as the MPs waited for the PIIP and the CS.   KAA says its application to manage the facility will be granted if it meets approval from the regulator.
