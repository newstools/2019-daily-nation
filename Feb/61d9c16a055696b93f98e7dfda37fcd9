Police in Likoni have arrested two minors in connection with the loss of Kenya Navy uniforms. The juveniles aged 13 and 15 are said to have stolen the uniforms from a cloth line at a Kenya Navy officer’s home in Mtongwe on Wednesday. The primary school pupils are said to be friends of the officer’s son. According to an officer from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the uniforms were later recovered from the Class Eight and Class Seven pupils’ home. UNIFORMS Likoni police boss Benjamin Rotich said the two suspects would be taken to the children’s court after probe is complete. “They will be charged with stealing and being in custody of Kenya Navy uniforms,” said Mr Rotich. The children’s parents visited Likoni Police Station later on Wednesday and were allowed to take them home. The officers handling the case said the suspects will be required to report to Likoni Police Station on Saturday as the investigations continue.
