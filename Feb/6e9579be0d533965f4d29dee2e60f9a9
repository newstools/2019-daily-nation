A boda boda rider on Thursday night killed a 40-year-old man he claimed was having an affair with his wife before surrendering to the police. In a police report, the Nairobi-based boda boda rider said he arrived at his rural home in Leleshwa village in Nyandarua County at around 10pm, only to find a stranger in bed with his wife. In a fit of rage, he picked a machete and slashed the victim on the neck, killing him on the spot, before walking to Kipipiri Police Station where he reported incident. “It seems the boda boda rider had been tipped about the illicit affair,” said Kipipiri Officer Commanding Police Division Charles Rotich. Mr Rotich said the suspect’s wife, who sneaked out after the incident, was being sought to assist the police with investigations. RECORD STATEMENT “We are treating the case as an outright murder, the suspect will be arraigned in court after recording a statement," added Mr Rotich. Some of the neighbours said that the victim had been seen entering the boda boda rider’s house at odd hours. “The victim seemed to have taken advantage of the absence of the man of the house who works in Nairobi to have an affair with his wife,” said a neighbour who declined to be named. Police took the victim’s body to Gilgil Sub County Hospital mortuary.
