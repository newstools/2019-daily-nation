Even as the security agencies step up efforts to enhance safety across the country, the terrorist threat, especially in the major towns, calls for increased vigilance by the public. After all, there are not enough numbers of police and other security personnel to cover every nook and cranny at all times. It simply means that the people must increasingly play a role in boosting their own security. This they can do by being alert and volunteering to the authorities information on suspicious characters, events or developments in their areas. The pattern of terror attacks indicates that terrorists heavily rely on local contacts. Residents must not ignore suspect movements in their neighbourhoods and only own up later that they had suspected that something was amiss, after an attack has occurred. This is where the Nyumba Kumi system comes in. Unfortunately, the roll-out of this initiative has been rather slow. The officials speak proudly about its effectiveness, but there is hardly sufficient evidence of it being in operation. It is, however, a potentially effective system of gathering intelligence on terror cells and channelling it to the security agencies for prompt action. Terrorism poses a grave threat and, therefore, calls for greater public alert. It is a deadly global phenomenon that calls for international co-operation in combating. It is for this reason that we must take seriously an alert from the US Embassy in Nairobi of credible information that Westerners might be targeted by extremists in Nairobi, Naivasha and Nanyuki and the coastal areas. However, these foreigners are among us and the attackers will not isolate them. There is, therefore, a need for heightened vigilance in the likely targets. Everybodyâ€™s co-operation is essential in the effort to keep the terrorists at bay.
