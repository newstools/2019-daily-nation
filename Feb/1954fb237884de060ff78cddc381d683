Police in Tana Delta have arrested a couple for marrying off their 15-year-old daughter to a 37-year-old man. The girl was married off soon after sitting her 2018 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams to a local primary school chairman. The 46-year-old father and mother, 34, are alleged to have married off their daughter in exchange of gifts. Tana Delta Deputy County Commissioner Charles Akwanalo told the Nation that after conducting a series of tests on the girl, it was established that the minor had been defiled by the suspect. ARRAIGNED "The two are in (police) custody and will be arraigned in court. The father insisted that that the girl must be married off, " he said. The suspect, who is an official at Odole Primary School, where the girl sat her KCPE last year, is still on the run. Several leaders in the county have since pledged to support the girl who scored 279 marks. Sources in the security team revealed to the Nation that some local politicians and elders were raising money to have the case settled out of court. DEFILEMENT However, Mr Akwanalo has warned that due to the sensitivity of the case that has since attracted defilement charges, his team will not relent on its efforts to apprehend the suspect. He warned that anybody who plans to interfere with the case will be arrested and charged. "Nobody is above the law, this case will not favour anybody despite the rank they hold in the society,‚Äù he said.
