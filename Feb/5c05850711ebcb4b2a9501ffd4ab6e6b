Police arrested two people on Monday after they were caught offloading bhang worth an estimated Sh4.5 million at a Nairobi estate. The bhang was transported to Kahawa Sukari estate in a petrol tanker and the two were putting rolls in sacks. Kiambu County Commander Adiel Nyange said they were alerted by residents who saw men offloading suspicious items from the vehicle. “The two will be taken to court tomorrow (Tuesday) as we investigate where they were transporting the bhang from,” said Mr Nyange. The dealer is believed to be one of the suspects Kiambu police are closely monitoring.     On February 3, police nabbed bhang with a street value of more than Sh3 million in Emali along Mombasa-Nairobi highway. They found the 6,180 rolls of bhang stuffed in sacks in a private car whose occupants abandoned it when they realised officers on patrol were following them. None of the people said to have been transporting the bhang to Mombasa County were apprehended as they fled on foot. A search was launched.   Police warn transporters and traders against colluding with traffickers.
