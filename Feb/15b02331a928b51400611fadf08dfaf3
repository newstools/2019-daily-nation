A family in Loo Yom Village in Ndhiwa, Homa Bay County is mourning the killing of their 15-year-old girl by unknown people. The body of the Class Seven pupil at Pala Primary School was found on dumped on a roadside on Thursday night. Her mother Ms Melvine Atieno said the girl was attacked while on her way to buy food in Ndhiwa town. “We became suspicious when she took long to return home.  She was sent to the market to buy sugar and eggs,” the mother said. The family, who suspect she was strangled to death by rapists, have threatened to delay burial until suspects are arrested. “We do not want a repeat of such acts in this area.  Police should ensure that the suspects are eliminated from our midst,” said Kanyamwa Kosewe ward representative Nichola Owaka. Preliminary investigations showed that the pupil had no external injuries caused by defilement. Homa Bay County Police Commander Esther Seroney said a post-mortem report conducted at the referral hospital mortuary ruled out defilement. But more tests will be conducted to establish what killed the teenage girl.
