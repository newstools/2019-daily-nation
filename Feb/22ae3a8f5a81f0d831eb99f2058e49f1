Judy Wangui, one of the suspects in the murder of Mary Wambui, has complained that detectives have been torturing her. Ms Wangui, through her lawyer Cliff Ombeta, told Kiambu Senior Principal Magistrate Stella Atambo that two female officers from Juja Police Station assaulted her on Friday night. Besides causing her injuries on her thighs and upper part of the body, she alleged that the officers inserted pepper in her private parts. She told the magistrate that she reported the matter to the OCS but it was not addressed. 'DEEPER PROBING' This was revealed during the hearing of an application by detectives from the homicide unit who requested to hold her, her boyfriend Joseph Kori and car hire dealer Michael Githae Mathenge detained for another 14 days. The new detectives who took over the investigation two days ago told the magistrate that they want to tie up loose ends before charging the suspects. They described the murder investigation as complex and technical and said there are pending issues that need deeper probing. But the defence lawyers objected to the application, saying it's unconstitutional and unreasonable. KORI PLEA Mr Kori, who occasionally got emotional during the arraignment, asked the court to release him to take care of his children and bury his wife. The suspects are being represented by five lawyers. The court has allowed police to detain them for nine working days at Muthaiga Police Station.
