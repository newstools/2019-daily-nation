Kirinyaga County Health executive Agnes Gachoki has resigned, citing frustrations from Governor Anne Waiguru. Dr Gachoki tendered her resignation on Thursday evening. The minister, who has 10 years’ experience in medicine, said she was unhappy with the way the executive was handling the health department. “I can’t work under the current administration because it has been frustrating me when carrying out my official duties,” she said. “My advice to the governor on how to improve the Health sector was ignored and I always felt very disturbed." Ms Waiguru could not be reached for comment. Efforts to get a comment from the deputy governor, Peter Ndambiri, were also unsuccessful as his phone went unanswered. Last year, while launching a programme for making linen for patients at Kerugoya hospital, Ms Waiguru described Dr Gachoki as one of her most active officers.
