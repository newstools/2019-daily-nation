Malindi divisional police commander (OCPD) Matawa Mchangi died on Monday, days after being admitted at Premier Hospital in Nyali, Mombasa County. Mr Mchangi was rushed to the facility on Friday night after collapsing in his home and breaking his collarbone, according to Coast regional police boss Marcus Ocholla. "The officer had been suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure but died a natural death," said Mr Ocholla. Mr Mchangi, a senior superintendent of police (SSP), had served in Malindi, Kilifi County, for more than four years.   Scientists on Friday unveiled a revised classification for diabetes, one they said could lead to better treatments and help doctors more accurately predict life-threatening complications from the disease.
