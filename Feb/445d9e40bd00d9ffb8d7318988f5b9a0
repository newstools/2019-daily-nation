Former Kenya Cup side Western Bulls RFC on Saturday moved to the summit of the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship League standing table as they keep their promotion to Kenya Cup alive. Echulusi registered 39-6 win over basement club South Coast Pirates on Saturday and benefitted from previous leaders Catholic Monks and second placed USIU losses in on the road to go top. Catholic Monks lost 8-15 to Masinde Muliro in Kakamega while USIU were edged out 21-15 by Kitale. Bulls, under Bramwel Shikanda, are now perched at the top of Championship log with 33 points, a point ahead of USIU and Monks after nine matches. Shikanda is optimistic and confident that they will re-join the premier rugby competition in the country next season after a two-year stay in the second division. “Our quest to re-join the Kenya Cup League has just started. The players are in top form due to consistent training.” The former winger singled out hooker Dan Chebui, fly half Suleiman Abubakar and Derrick Ashihundu for their outstanding performances against the struggling South Coast-outfit. The Pirates have a single win so far, a walk over after Kisii RFC failed to travel to Diani two weeks ago. USIU were knocked off the top position for the first time this season after they suffered their second loss of the season to Ben Amboko’s boys in Kitale. The top six sides at the end of the regular season will qualify for the play offs where the sixth placed side play the third placed as number four take on number five. The winners will then play league winners and runners up for a chance to gain promotion to Kenya Cup. A resurgent Bulls has also advanced to the pre-quarterfinals of the KRU Enterprise Cup without kicking the ball after their opponents Egerton Wasps failed to show up in Kakamega.   Suleiman Abubakar scored a hat-trick of tries for Western Bulls.
