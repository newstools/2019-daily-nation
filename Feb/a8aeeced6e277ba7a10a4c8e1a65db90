City lawyer Harun Ndubi has been charged with offences including hitting and injuring a traffic police motorcycle rider on Sunday night. Mr Ndubi was arrested on Sunday and taken to a Milimani court on Monday. He was accused of driving his Toyota Harrier, registration KCA 820B, without due care and attention for other road users. The senior human rights lawyer also faced a charge of failing to give way thereby hitting the motorcycle, a Yamaha XI900 registration GKB891Q, and damaging it. The police rider in question was Constable Simon Munga. PLEAS Mr Ndubi pleaded not guilty to the charges before Senior Principal Magistrate Elector Riany. He also denied refusing to take a breathalyser test that would have determined if he was drunk. Mr Ndubi's lawyer Dr John Khaminwa had filed an application against his prosecution but the State prosecutor opposed it and the magistrate ruled in his favour. Dr Khaminwa also applied to defer the plea-taking, pending the determination of a High Court case by his client, that challenged the constitutionality of traffic rules. In opposition, the State prosecutor said, â€œThe court cannot stay this prosecution to await the outcome of a decision of the High Court whose judgement date has not been stated." Ms Riany therefore asked the accused to plead to the charges and told him he could turn to the High Court to challenge his trial. Mr Ndubi was asked to deposit a cash bail of Sh80,000 in order to be released.   Traffic police take lawyer to Kilimani after arrest in Nairobi.
