Two populous regions in Tanzania have been hit by condom shortage raising fears of a possible increase in number of sexually transmitted infections. Tanzania’s deputy Health Minister Faustine Ndugulile said the government was aware that Njombe and Shinyala regions have been affected. The two regions have a combined population of more than two million people according to a 2012 study. Dr Ndugulile, who was speaking at an orphanage in Dar es Salaam on February 19, said the shortage was caused by the government’s new procurement policy. He said in the new policy, the government has undertaken to provide free condoms by cutting off private suppliers. “It is true that there is shortage of condoms, which is attributed to the change of supplying system…However, this signifies that the Tanzanian population are educated enough to use protection,” Mr Ndugulile he added.   Locals claim condoms supply has been so low that they are forced to wash them for reuse.
