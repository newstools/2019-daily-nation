A gathering of international education experts has thrown its weight behind a global campaign to ensure universal primary education for every child, especially those in poor countries. Speaking during the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) conference in Qatar recently, the delegates committed to galvanise the global education community to confront issues standing in the way of access to education.   Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the founder of the Education Above All Foundation based in Qatar, said they will reach out to governments across the world to have millions of children who are out of school get enrolled.   "In order to innovate new solutions to the challenges like monitoring, among others, Education Above All is launching a new strategy to be implemented in selected countries with the aim of ensuring the number of out-of-school children is reduced to zero,” she told more than 2,000 delegates attending the conference in Doha. Speakers included international advocate for women’s and children’s rights Grace Machel, global entertainer and goodwill ambassador for Unicef Shakira, Stephen Katende of Building Tomorrow in Uganda and Michael Pollack of Educate Girls in US among others.   During the summit, Akilah Institute, a women’s college based in Kigali, Rwanda, was recognised for “delivering high quality, market-relevant education” for women and running a campus culture that celebrates creativity, innovation and servant leadership. The college offers advanced diplomas in hospitality and tourism management, information technology, business management and entrepreneurship.   Other winners were education start-ups based in India, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Liberia, US and UK. The summit is held bi-annually. It seeks to enable Education Above All to leverage a global platform to identify and celebrate many innovative approaches in the education sector.
