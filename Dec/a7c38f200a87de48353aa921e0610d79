Rainfall intensity will fall in most parts of the country over the next seven days, the Kenya Meteorological Department has said. The news comes following heavy rain across the country, which has led to more than 100 deaths, thousands of displaced people and loss of property, with northern Kenya being the worst hit. “Rainfall is expected to reduce over most parts of the country. However, on Saturday, December 21, rainfall is expected to spread to several places over Central, Southeast, Southwest and Coastal areas,” said Mr Bernard Chanzu, the acting deputy director at the Kenya Meteorological Department. Mr Chanzu said rain has been reducing since the start of this month. “Rainfall decreased over several parts of the country with both day-time (maximum) temperatures and night time (minimum) temperatures decreasing,” he said.
