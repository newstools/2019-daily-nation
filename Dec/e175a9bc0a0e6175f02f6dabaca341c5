More than 180 passengers were on Monday night stranded at Makindu and Emali police stations after police officers impounded four buses belonging to Chania Genesis company for violating a travel ban by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA). Speaking to the Nation on Tuesday morning, Makueni County Police Commander Joseph ole Napeiyan said the drivers will be charged with violating the ban which was imposed on Monday evening. On Sunday morning, six people were seriously injured after a Chania Genesis bus in which they were traveling hit a truck at Manga along the busy Nairobi-Mombasa highway. It is believed that this incident occasioned the ban on the bus company. NOT AWARE But, speaking to the Nation on Tuesday morning, the stranded passengers, who were travelling to Mombasa, said they were not aware of the NTSA ban by the time they boarded the buses. Police advised them to board other buses to their destinations. FARES Most of them appealed for a refund of their fares.
