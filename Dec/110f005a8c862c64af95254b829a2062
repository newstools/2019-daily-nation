A son of the late former vice-president Michael Kijana Wamalwa, William Makali Wamalwa, is dead. His uncle, Robert Wamalwa, Monday confirmed that his nephew died on Sunday evening at their Milimani home in Kitale, Trans Nzoia County. The family suspects it could be diabetes that led to his death but are waiting for a post-mortem report. "My nephew was diabetic and that might have led to his death but, of course, when the official post-mortem report is out, we will know what happened," Mr Wamalwa told the Nation. UNIVERSITY STUDENT Makali, who was the third born in his family, was in his mid-20s and was a second year student at the University of Nairobi where he was studying commerce. His uncle dismissed claims on social media that Makali died of depression, alcoholism and drug abuse. "It is far from the truth. It is very unfair and people should not capitalise on something like that. They should respect the family and the dead," said Mr Wamalwa. He added that he was with his nephew the previous day and he looked fine. An official family statement will be given after a post-mortem examination report is released. Makali will be buried at the familyâ€™s Three Rivers farm in Saboti on December 14, 2019.
