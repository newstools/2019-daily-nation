The principal of troubled St Mary’s Girls' High School in Igoji has been transferred in changes that have affected 35 schools heads in Meru County. Ms Petronilla Maria Mulwa has been moved to Mulala Secondary School in Makueni County and will be succeeded by Ms Isabella Wanjiku from Loreto Matunda High School in Uasin Gishu County. A list released by Ms Esther Musani, Meru's Director of the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), says the changes were immediate. LOAN Ms Mulwa tenure was troubled as she clashed with parents after about 600 students were sent home in July over a Sh44 million loan the institution procured seven years ago. The money was borrowed from a commercial bank for construction of a dormitory at the school sponsored by a Catholic Church. Under the arrangement, parents of the national school are to pay Sh22,000 annually, above the regular fees, until the loan is cleared. They protested, with some calling for an audit, saying the amount borrowed for the project may have been exaggerated.
