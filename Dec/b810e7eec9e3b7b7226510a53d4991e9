Motorists parking their cars in the Nairobi Central Business District (CBD) can now breathe a sigh of relief after the county government reverted its fees to Sh200. They have been paying Sh400 since Wednesday last week despite a court order that stopped the increase until a case filed by the Consumer Federation of Kenya (Cofek) is heard and determined. City Hall Director of Parking Services Tom Tinega said the county had not been served with the court order and that this was only done this afternoon. The move to raise parking fees, which was effective December 4, was met with uproar from matatu operators and the consumer lobby. The increase would have seen 14-seater matatus pay Sh5,000, up from Sh3,650, 32-seater buses pay Sh8,000, up from Sh5,250, and 41 and above seater buses pay Sh10,000, up from Sh7,250 they have been paying since 2014. Matatu owners threatened to resort to mass action while Cofek sued City Hall on grounds that motorists were not given sufficient notice as required by the law. Cofek had threatened to sue the county government once again for contempt of court while accusing City Hall of disregarding an existing court order. High Court Judge James Makau directed that the case be heard on January 21, 2020.
