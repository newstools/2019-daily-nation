A woman, who was charged with circumcising her two daughters, was on Friday released on Sh1 million bond by a Tharaka-Nithi court. Mary Kanyua was charged with taking her daughters aged 16 and 10 to Katse in Kitui County where the girls underwent the ‘cut’. When the girls returned home, suspicious neighbours reported to local administrators who took the girls to hospital. Medics confirmed that the girls had been circumcised. In her defence, Kanyua told the court that she was not aware that her daughters had been circumcised. She accused the girls’ grandmother, who died early this month, of circumcising the teenagers. The case will be heard on January 6. Tharaka South Sub-County Police Commander Kiprop Rutto said police are also looking for girls’ father, who is at large. The girls are currently in a rescue centre in Marimanti. Cases of FGM are still rampant in the region, although many are embracing alternative rite of passage according to Tharaka-Nithi County Commissioner Beverly Opwora.
