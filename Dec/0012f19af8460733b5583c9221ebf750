Christmas came early for tens of Nakuru town residents on Wednesday morning after a door of a lorry ferrying soya beans accidentally opened near the Kenya Farmers Association roundabout. Equipped with sacks, carton boxes, and buckets, the residents rushed to scoop the soya beans that had spilled on road. The scramble led to a huge traffic jam after the residents blocked the Nakuru-Eldoret highway, each trying to scoop as much of the soya beans as possible. Many threw caution to the wind as they seemed oblivious of the risk of being hit by vehicles plying the busy highway. EARLY CHRISTMAS Some were heard celebrating as they thanked God for “remembering them by bringing Christmas early to them”. “After God has helped us to get these bags of soya beans, He should also organise on how we should get maize, beans and other goodies ahead of Christmas,” a boda boda rider shouted. Another resident said he could not have hesitated to stop by and get some share of the spilled beans even though he was late for work. “At times you have to consider where you’ve come from and not necessarily where you are heading to. This could be a morning blessing to some of us,” she said. The driver of the lorry and his turn boy watched helplessly from a distance. They declined to speak to the journalist over the incident. The lorry was destined to Eldoret town.
