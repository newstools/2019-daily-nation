Kenya Lionesses star Janet Okello was crowned Athlete of the Year at the 2019 Magharibi Michezo Awards gala in Bungoma on Monday. The Kenyan international, who plays her club rugby for Stanbic Mwamba, has been an integral part of the Lionesses and played a key part in the team’s qualification for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. This was second of two awards on the night for Okello who had earlier been crowned the 2019 Magharibi Women’s Rugby Player of The Year. Vihiga Queens prodigy Jentrix Shikangwa, who scored a double in Harambee Starlets' 2-0 victory over Tanzania in last month’s Cecafa Women’s Challenge Cup final, also bagged two awards on the night, taking home the Most Promising Player Award in addition to being crowned the Women’s Footballer of The Year. WANGA FETED Former Harambee Stars striker Allan Wanga, now plying his trade with Kakamega Homeboyz, won the Men’s Footballer of The Year Award. Blazers youngster Eleanor Chebet crowned a memorable debut season that saw her earn a call up to the Kenya women’s hockey team that played in the Olympic qualifiers in South Africa when she took home the Women’s Hockey Player of The Year. Another youngster claiming an accolade at the Awards was Menengai Oilers’ centre Austine Sikutwa who lifted the Men’s Rugby Player of The Year.
