Hi Brenda, I have been into this relationship for six months. He has an eight year-old son from his past relationship. He promised to marry me, but was only good to me for the first three months. Things turned sour as the relationship continued. He has been lying to me. Whenever I call, he declines and if he picks up, he tells me to stop disturbing him. Should I continue with that relationship? Destiny's Child.  Dear Destiny’s Child, The writing is on the wall. I was feeling bad as I read your story because if we’re being honest, you and I both know that when a man starts acting like this, he is done. If he wanted you, he would be clear. Now that he doesn’t, he’s trying to drive you away. He could only maintain the charade for three months (as he promised to marry you), and then now as he tells you to stop disturbing him, you should listen. Stop disturbing him and stop disturbing your spirit. It’s over, because he didn’t have the guts to be honest. Leave it be.
