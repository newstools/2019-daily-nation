Ivorian striker Gislain Yikpe is on the verge of joining Yanga Sports Club, according to media reports in Tanzania. The towering Ivorian was pictured at the Julius Nyerere International Airport accompanied by a Yanga official with Tanzanian media reporting the forward has agreed terms with the club. “Gislain Yikpe has arrived in Dar es Salaam to join Yanga. After holding talks with the club, the Ivorian striker has agreed to terminate his contract with Kenyan champions Gor Mahia,” Viwanjani Leo reported. The lanky forward joined K’Ogalo mid this year from Guinean Ligue 1 side Hafia FC on a two-year contract. Gor Mahia CEO Lordvick Aduda however said the player has not served any notice neither have they received any communication from Yanga regarding the reported move. “We will definitely pick it up with Yanga and the relevant authorities. We are not opposed to any player moving but the laid down rules and regulations must be followed,” Aduda told Nation Sport on Friday. K’Ogalo are undergoing financial difficulties with players owed salaries and allowances for over four months now. According to Fifa rules, a player is free to move to another club if he/she hasn’t been paid for over two months, provided he gives sufficient notice and this could be the avenue Yanga want to explore. Despite a slow start in Kenya, Yikpe's potential was evident as he grabbed a brace as Gor thrashed rivals AFC Leopards 4-1 in November.
