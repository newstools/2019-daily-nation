Gor Mahia have named a strong line up to face Kisumu All Stars in a Kenyan Premier League (KPL) match on Sunday at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. Joash Onyango, Harambee Stars skipper at the just concluded Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup in Kampala, has been benched with Charles Momanyi and Joachim Oluoch partnering at the heart of defence. Boniface Oluoch starts between the sticks with Nicholas Kipkirui and Dickson Ambundo tasked with the goal hunting duties. Midfielder Lawrence Juma and club captain Kenneth Muguna, who were also in Kampala with Harambee Stars for the Challenge Cup, have started in midfield. The team travelled to Kisumu Saturday morning and held an evening training session at the match venue. However, coach Steven Polack is expected to fly back to the United Kingdom immediately after the match for a short holiday. The match kicks off at 3pm.
