A court in Voi, Taita-Taveta County, has postponed Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's case after he failed to appear on Wednesday citing health reasons. According to his lead lawyer, Cecil Miller, the governor was ill and could not appear in court to take a plea. The governor had been summoned to face assault, resisting arrest and offensive conduct charges. He is accused of assaulting Coast Region Police Commander Rashid Yakub at Ikanga airstrip in Voi during his dramatic arrest about a fortnight ago. The governor had declined to board a police helicopter that had landed at the airstrip to airlift him to Nairobi for questioning over corruption allegations. STOP ARREST Police bundled him into the waiting aircraft as his aides confronted the officers trying to stop them from arresting him. On Wednesday, Mr Miller told Senior Resident Magistrate Fredrick Nyakundi that the governor is receiving treatment at home after he was diagnosed with hypertension and soft tissue injury. According to a letter signed by the governor's doctor and deposited in court by his defence team, the county boss is currently on bed rest with close monitoring. Consequently, Magistrate Nyakundi fixed the matter for January 21, 2020 when Sonko will be expected to take a plea.
