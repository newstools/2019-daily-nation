A court has ordered the arrest of two directors of the Solai killer dam which left over 40 people dead. The duo is wanted to face charges of Sh2bn land fraud allegedly committed 34 years ago alongside two others. Mr Mansukhulal Shantilal Patel and Mr Mansukh Kasangra, directors of Kensalt Limited are accused alongside a former legislator Lawu Kigen Kiplagat and a trader James Wainaina Ng’ang’a. Mr Kiplagat and Mr Ng’ang’a were arraigned in a Makadara court Monday. The accused face four charges of conspiracy to commit a felony, forgery and forceful detention of property. They are accused of forging a title deed of 10 acre parcel of land valued at Sh2bn, the property of Tafflus Manufacturers Company. Tafflus is associated with a former Lamu East MP-the late Abubakhar Madhubuti. The offence was allegedly committed between July 1, 1985 and July 13 1994. Mr Patel and Mr Kasangra are further charged with being in possession of the parcel of land at Kia Ng’ombe within Embakasi Nairobi County of December 23, 2019. Defence lawyer William Arusei opposed Mr Kiplagat taking plea saying there is a pending high court matter over ownership of the land. Another defence lawyer George Okatch for Mr Ng’ang’a said his client is not a party to the high court case and asked the court that he be allowed to take plea. He denied the charge and was released on Sh1million bond until April 30,2020 when the case will be heard.
