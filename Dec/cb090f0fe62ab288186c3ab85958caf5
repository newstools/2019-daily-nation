Mr Kinyua said the boy’s body had severe injuries on the head and face. He said the suspect, who admitted to killing the boy, said he was possessed by evil spirits. “The suspect led our officers to the area where he dumped the boy’s body after committing the crime, he claimed that he had been possessed with evil spirits. He will be charged with murder,” Mr Kinyua said. The boy’s disappearance was reported at Murang’a Police Station on December 5, 2019. The victim’s mother claimed her lover took the boy to his rental house near Murang’a University. It was after the suspect went missing that the woman became curious and reported the matter to the police before a search ensued. The police boss the public and especially lovers, to solve their love and marital issues amicably instead of taking law in their own hands. “No one should kill because he or she has been aggrieved, when one feels he is not happy with his friend or he has been offended, one has the option of walking away or even reporting the matter to the police instead of killing,” he said.
