The national women’s volleyball team will begin their Tokyo 2020 Olympics Africa qualifiers against arch-rivals Egypt on January 5 in Yaoundé, according to the draw released by the African Volleyball Confederation on Thursday. Kenya last played the North Africans in 2017 during the Africa Cup of Nations-cum-World Championships qualifiers in Cameroon during the semi-finals where the Malkia Strikers won 3-1. But both teams have in recent international events failed to meet and Kenya coach Paul Bitok he is not sure of what to expect from Egypt. “While all the focus in on Cameroon because of their sudden rise and their competitiveness, we should not forget that Egypt which we haven’t played in recent times are a threat too and can cause an upset,” said Bitok. “They are away in Brazil for build-up matches. While it may work for or against either of teams by virtue having not played against each other for a while now, we hope to start our campaign on high and win against them as that will place us at better place going forward. It will not be easy match but we are hopeful.” FACE CAMEROON Kenya will then take on Botswana on January 6 before tackling nemesis and hosts Cameroon on Day Three in what could be the decider for the sole slot reserved for the continent at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. A potentially explosive match between Cameroon and Egypt is also in the offing on January 8. Kenya, who last played in the Olympic in 2004 in Athens, will rest on January 8 before they wrap up the four-nation tournament with a tie against Nigeria on January 9. The overall winner of the five-day event will represent the continent during the Olympics between July 24-to August 9. Cameroon represented Africa in the 2016 Rio Olympics.
