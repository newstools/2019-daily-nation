Bandari's brief renaissance was on Wednesday checked by Kakamega Homeboyz who beat them 1-0 in a Kenyan Premier League match at the Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega. Chris Masinza's goal in the ninth minute settled the tight contest as the dockers slumped to another defeat in this campaign. The hosts were missing the services of Moses Mudavadi who is away with the national team for the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup in Uganda but it didn't matter as Masinza put them ahead just under 10 minutes in. It was Masinza's second goal in the league since joining from Vihiga United in June. The winger timed his run to connect to David Okoth's cross from the left. Bandari sought to reply but their attacking trio of Wilberforce Lugogo, Yema Mwana and William Wadri was thwarted by the Homeboyz defence marshalled by Kennedy Onyango. Wadri though he had equalised for the visitors but his shot was saved by Gabriel Andika in the 33rd minute after beating Collins Odhiambo. Ali Bai almost doubled Homeboyz's lead in the 51st minute but he was denied by an onrushing Bandari custodian Justin Ndikumana. Both coaches made substitutions in the second half. Bandari's Bernard Mwalala withdrew Wadri and Lugogo for Wycliffe Ochomo and David King'atua respectively. Homeboyz coach Nicholas Muyoti replaced Stephen Wakanya and Masinza with Dennis Sosi and Noah Wafula respectively. The win sends Kakamega Homeboyz top of the log with 26 points from 13 matches albeit temporarily pending other results. Bandari are 13th with 12 points.
