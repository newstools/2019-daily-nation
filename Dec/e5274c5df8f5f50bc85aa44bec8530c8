Kevin Mbugua Kimemia from Springs High School in Gilgil sub-county is the most-improved student in Nakuru County. He scored a B-plus of 74 points despite joining the institution with 200 marks. Still basking in his unexpected success, Kevin says he wants to pursue a degree in industrial chemistry at the university. “I am happy that I have attained such a high score and I thank God for bringing me this far. I believe He will continue blessing me.” Monicah Kimani, the director of Springs High School, says the institution is setting a precedent in the county by producing top students. “This school produced the most improved student countrywide in last year’s KCSE. This year we have managed to produce the most improved in the county” says Ms Kimani. She says discipline and close follow-up on students coupled with dedicated teachers and a Christian background have made the quality of education to improve. Kevin, who is an orphan, had his fees paid by the school. Ms Kimani is however appealing to any well-wishers to support Kevin through his university education. “We would appreciate well-wishers willing to assist Kevin at the university level since we have been with him from primary school and he has proved to be a bright and disciplined student who is eager to learn” she says.
