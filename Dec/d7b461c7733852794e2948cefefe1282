Struggling Kenyan Premier League (KPL) side Wazito have dropped two more players with Ugandan duo of Mansoor Safi and former Tusker winger Mathew Tayo Odongo the latest casualties. The moneybags had earlier in the week confirmed the axing of former Gor Mahia fullbacks Abouba Sibomana and Karim Nizigiyimana, young midfielder John Mutua and goalkeeper Gad Mathews Otieno. “We want to thank them for their services to Wazito and wish them well for the future,” team manager Bramwell Makotsi is quoted as saying by the club’s official portal. The team also revealed they are in talks with possible replacements for the dropped players. “We want to strengthen our weak areas. We have identified some good players and we are in talks with them and their clubs. Their identities will be revealed in due course.” The team is currently 13th on the log with 11 points from 14 matches. Their next league fixture is against reigning champions Gor Mahia on January 5 at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos.
