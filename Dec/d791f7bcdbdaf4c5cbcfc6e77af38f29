Among the victims were eight officers who were returning to their work stations in Elram, Mandera. In June this year, seven officers lost their lives after their vehicle ran over an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in Konton area. This is the fourth terrorist attack in Wajir County in a span of three months. The porous Kenya-Somalia border has made the Northern region a perfect staging ground for attacks by the Somalia-based ragtag militia.
