Court of Appeal Judge Prof Otieno Odek collapsed and died Monday in his home in Milimani Estate, Kisumu County. Kisumu Chief Magistrate Julius Ng'arng'ar confirmed news of his death, saying police officers and a pathologist were at the scene. The body has been moved to Aga Khan Hospital mortuary, Kisumu. According to Mr Ng'arng'ar, Prof Odek was last seen on Friday. He did not respond to phone calls asking him to report on duty this morning. Prof Odek's driver, having not reached him on the phone Monday morning, alerted his colleagues and court staff. Police then went to his house.   They accessed his home with the help of the caretaker by removing one of the glass windows. When they went in, the television set was on and the judge's phones were on the table. "He was facing up and was covered normally like someone who is asleep. Preliminary investigations showed that there wasn't any struggle but the pathologist will issue a comprehensive statement," said Chief Magistrate Ng'arng'ar.   The house is located about 50 metres from the Kisumu Central Police Station.   Prof Odek became a Judge of the Court of Appeal in 2012. MARAGA MOURNS Chief Justice David Maraga sent his condolences to the judge's family and friends, terming his death a shocking loss. "He was not only a distinguished Judge but also a prolific legal scholar who was widely published and celebrated across the continent and beyond. On behalf of the Judiciary, the Judicial Service Commission and on my own behalf, I wish to express our heartfelt condolences," the judiciary boss said in a statement.
