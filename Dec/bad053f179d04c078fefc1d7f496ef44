Harambee Stars head coach Francis Kimanzi has called up Tusker forward Timothy Otieno to the national team ahead of Council of East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa) Senior Challenge Cup slated for December 7 to 19 in Uganda. Otieno, who is the Kenyan Premier League top scorer with seven goals, has gotten the nod alongside Western Stima custodian Samuel Odhiambo who replaces the injured Brian Bwire. Bandari sensation Mohamed Katana has also been called up. Kenya has been pooled in Group 'C' alongside Tanzania, Djibouti and Zanzibar, and will be looking to defend the title they won in December 2017, in Machakos. Group A is comprised of hosts Uganda, Burundi, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, while Group B will pit guest team DR Congo against Sudan, South Sudan, and Somalia. The top two teams in each group, as well as two best losers from the three groups, will proceed to the tournamentâ€™s quarter-finals.
