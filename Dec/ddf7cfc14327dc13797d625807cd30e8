Harambee Stars remained static at position 106 globally in the latest rankings released by world football governing body, Fifa on Friday. Kenya is ranked 25th in Africa and second in the Cecafa region after Uganda who are 77th in the world while Sudan (128), Rwanda (131) and Tanzania (134) are third, fourth and fifth respectively. Other than the recently concluded Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup in Tanzania that doesn’t count in the rankings, Stars have been inactive since the 1-1 draw against Togo in an 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in November in Nairobi. Senegal is the highest ranked nation in the continent followed by Tunisia, Nigeria and African champions Algeria while Belgium remain top of the world followed by France, Brazil and England. The ‘Mover of the Year’, meanwhile, is Qatar. They gained a massive 138 points over the course of a year in which they won the Asian Cup and made a strong start to the Asian Zone of World Cup qualifiers. Besides accumulating the biggest points haul, Qatar also climbed 38 places, followed closely by fellow climbers Algeria (up 32 ranks) and Japan (up 22 places).
