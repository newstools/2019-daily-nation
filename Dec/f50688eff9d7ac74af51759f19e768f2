Police in Matungulu are investigating the deaths of a young couple, whose decomposing bodies were found in a room of their rented house in Nguluni Trading Centre . Matungulu police boss Joel Kirui said the decomposing bodies of Stephen Mumo, 24 , and Miriam Anna,18, were found at 9 am on Wednesday by a neighbour. The police boss said the neighbour became suspicious of a foul smell which was coming from the couple's house. Mr Kirui said a preliminary investigation revealed that the woman, whoseÂ  body was found lying on a bed with some injuries may have been strangled by her man before he hanged himself from using a mosquito net. He said the two moved into the house recently. The bodies were moved to Kangundo Level Four Hospital mortuary.
