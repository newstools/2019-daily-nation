Transport along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway was paralysed for 8 hours early Wednesday following heavy traffic jam between Salama and the Machakos turn off. The jam started building up after three lorries collided near Malili township at 10 pm on Tuesday blocking the busy road. Seven people were injured according to Makueni County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim. They were rushed for treatment in Machakos County Referral Hospital. By Wednesday morning, hundreds of motorists were stranded between Salama and the Machakos turn-off on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. Travellers heading to and from Mombasa spent the night in the cold. The gridlock eased about 8 hours after the accident occurred following intervention of traffic police, opening a floodgate of buses and trucks revving to recover time lost from sitting in the gridlock.
