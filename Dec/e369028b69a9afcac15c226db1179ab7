Junior Starlets coach Jackeline Juma has said that the just concluded Cecafa Under 17 Women Challenge Cup held in Jinja was a great experience for the players. Kenya on Tuesday lost 2-0 to hosts Uganda in their final match of the six-team tourney to finish third with seven points, drawn from two wins, two losses and one draw. Uganda won the tournament with 13 points from four wins and a draw. Tanzania beat Djibouti 10-0 to finish second two points adrift of Uganda. "The tournament was a great lesson on what the team needs to work on if they want to compete in international events," Juma told Nation Sport. "We assembled the team three days to the tournament and therefore didn't have much time to prepare which might have affected our performance. But I'm glad we came in among the top three and now know what to do next year to get the tittle." Juma thanked the various high schools for releasing their players on short notice but also urged the institutions to get travelling documentation for the young girls early enough to avoid locking out some good players who could make a difference. "The team will be retained by the federation for future tournaments," she added.
