Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has fired eight county employees over corruption and gross misconduct. He made the move on Friday, warning that he will weed out everybody who engages in graft. Those sacked on Friday include Margaret Mwikali Mutisya (officer in charge of revenue, Muthetheni Ward), Stellamarris Mutinda (acting Deputy Sub-county Commander, Mwala), James Katana Changalwa (inspectorate officer Mwala) and Joshua Kiilu (inspectorate officer and driver, Mwala). The others are Winfred Mwikali Kitungai (Deputy ward Administrator, Mlolongo), James Makau (village administrator, Mlolongo), Thomas Muindi (public health officer, Mwala) and Moses Mwendwa Kaloki (procurement officer, Finance ministry). WARNING Governor Mutua also said he had ordered termination of workers in his office who engage in corruption or ask for bribes on behalf of others in order to make payments. He said he will send officials home every month if they do not share his aspiration of a 'clean', developed Kenya. “I have, on more than one occasion, urged Machakos government employees to serve wananchi in a speedy manner. They should not terrorise or frustrate wananchi or their colleagues so as to be bribed," he said. The governor said he will also accept the resignations of non-performing officers. “I urge all Machakos officers not to wait to be told to undertake maintenance of buildings and roads or accelerate delivery of quality services," he said. "I believe everyone knows what they are supposed to do. Either they change their attitudes or I change them."
