Kenya face Scotland in the 13th place play-off of Dubai Sevens on Saturday at 12:52pm at The Sevens Stadium. Kenya’s quest to win a match failed when they lost to Spain 22-19, hours after they had gone down England 12-5 to finish last in Pool “D”. Tries from Johnstone Olindi, Nelson Oyoo and Jacob Ojee failed to spur Kenya, who led 14-12 at the break. Pol Pla, Inaki Mateu, Pablo Fontes and Ignacio Rodriguez-Guerra landed a try each to hand Spain victory but it was all in vain as they also had dropped to play Ireland in the play-off for 11th place. This year’s World Rugby Sevens Series has adopted a new format where those finishing first and second in the pools proceed to Cup quarter-finals with the rest being paired in classification matches depending on their performances. Pool “D” winners South Africa, who beat England 19-14, face Argentina while England take on France in the Cup quarters. New Zealand play USA while Australia is up against Samoa in other Cup quarters showdown.
