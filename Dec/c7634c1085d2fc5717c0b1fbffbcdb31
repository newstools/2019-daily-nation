In June, people searched on how to apply for Census jobs. Last month, people searched for the BBI report, Kibra-by election and the Kenya Airways stowaway incident in London.“Google’s 2019 Year in Search showcases people, topics, events, and places that captured the world’s attention this year.''Just as Search can help you explore and discover a world of information, there are many ways to explore the year through the lens of Google Search,” Ms Ooko said. 'HOW TO' SEARCHESA majority of Kenyans wanted to know “how to file their tax returns”. This was closely followed by “How to apply for a passport” after the government moved passport applications to the E-citizen platform. Kenyans also wanted to know “how to download videos from YouTube”, indicating an interest in the YouTube platform and the content uploaded.“How to create a website” also topped the list, which could indicate the possible need for Kenyans to create digital platforms where they can host information about their businesses.In the ''What is'' category, Kenyans searched for ''What is census?'', ''What is Huduma Namba?'' after the mass registration that would see the issuance of new digital identity cards for all Kenyan residents, ''What is xenophobia?'' following the racial bouts of violence in South Africa, ''What is cancer?'' due to the increase in cancer cases which have claimed many lives including prominent names, and ''What is acute myeloid leukaemia?'' following the death of Bob Collymore.
