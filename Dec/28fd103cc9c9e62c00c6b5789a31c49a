Some once famous academic giants in the Rift Valley region failed to impress in the 2019 KCSE examination after posting results that fell below expectations of stakeholders, despite abundant availability of learning resources. FADE AWAY While a school like Kapsabet Boys’ High School in Nandi County maintained its stellar performance and produced the best student nationally, in addition to being ranked the country’s second best, some schools previously celebrated for producing top candidates recorded average results. Buluma Tony Wabuko from Kapsabet High was the best candidate, having attained a mean grade of A (87.15 points). The 2019 KCSE results also saw Moi High School, Kabarak, make a comeback to the top after underperforming for a few years. It was ranked fourth nationally and its best candidate, Kizito Ezra Sikuta, was in position six. He had a mean grade of A (86.96 points). The school had a mean score of 10.88. Famous schools in Nakuru County like Menengai High School, Nakuru Day Secondary School and Njoro Boys have faded away and their places taken by new ones like Langa Langa Secondary School, which had a mean score of 7.5. DISAPPOINTMENT Menengai High School had a mean score of 6.2 while Nakuru Day averaged 5.6 points, the same as Njoro Boys. In Turkana County, Lodwar Boys' High School did not, for the fourth year running, produce an A, with the top candidate, Frankline Loole Edonga, scoring an A- minus, to the disappointment of locals. The last time the national school produced a mean grade of A plain was in 2015. Samwel Nakata’s record of 82 points is yet to be broken. “This is not the Lodwar Boys we used to know and something needs to be done. The school’s management delayed to make the results public, meaning they knew they had performed below the expectations of many residents and leaders,” Mr Ekuwom Emmanuel, a resident, said. The school, which is currently ranked third in the county, had 5 B+, 19 B, 28 B- and 18C+ scores. ST PATRICK'S ITEN The school principal, Mr Patrick Lokwayen, said the school improved from a mean score of 5.6 in 2018 to the current 6.01. It had a mean score of 8.298 in 2015. Fallen giant In West Pokot County, Kapenguria Boys' High School, another school in the region that used to perform well in years gone by, had no student registering a mean grade of A. It had a mean score of 6.44, with nine students scoring A minus, 14 B plus, 33 B plain, 49 B minus and 55C plus. Ortum Boys' High School, another fallen giant, had a mean score of 4.1, while results for Chewoyet Boys' High School were yet to be made public. In Elgeyo Marakwet County, St Patrick’s High School, Iten, which for many years posted excellent results, had one student -- Njemela Antonio Kachilia -- scoring an A of 82 points. VARSITY QUALIFICATION The school had 15 students who attained an A minus mean grade, 46 B plus, 45, B plain and 47 B minus. It had a mean score of 7.7 with 191 students qualifying for admission to university. In Nandi County, Kapsabet Girls' High School had the leading 15 students, scoring A minus, 30 B plus, 79 B plain, 72 B minus and 65C plus. It had a mean score of 7.92 points. St Joseph Girls' School, Chepterit, another regional top school, had four students with A minus, 11 B plus, 30 B plain, 32 B minus and 49C plus. It had a mean score of 7.02 points and 126 candidates out of 207 qualifying for admission to university.
