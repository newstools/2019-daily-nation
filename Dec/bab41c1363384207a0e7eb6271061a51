World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge has been awarded a Doctorate Degree of Law by the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. According to the university, he was honoured due to his commitment in the field of sports and being a marathon record holder.

An honorary degree is an academic degree for which a university has waived the usual requirements such as enrollment, a dissertation and the passing of comprehensive examination. It is also known by the Latin phrases honoris causa ("for the sake of the honour") or ad honorem ("to the honour"). The degree is typically a doctorate or less commonly, a masterâ€™s degree, and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution or no previous post-secondary education. The degree is often conferred as a way of honouring a distinguished person's contributions to a specific field or to society in general.
