Kenyan internationals Joash Onyango and Jentrix Shikangwa are among the contenders for the men's and women's football accolades in the Magharibi Michezo Awards gala set for Monday in Bungoma County. Former Kenya international Allan Wanga, joint top scorer at the close of the 2019 Kenyan Premier League season with 17 goals for Kakamega Homeboyz, also makes the cut. Onyango, who plays his club football for record Kenyan champions Gor Mahia has been nominated alongside Bandari defender Brian Otieno. Others nominated alongside the defensive bulwarks are AFC Leopards midfielder Whyvonne Isuza as well as former Gor Mahia captain Harun Shakava - who now plies his trade with Zambian side Nkana FC. Up and coming Kariobangi Sharks player Daniel Sakari rounds off the list of men's nominees. Vihiga Queens and Harambee Starlets prodigy Shikangwa is in the running for the women's award but faces stiff competition from club mates Tereza Engesha, Cynthia Shilwatso, Topista Situma, Oserian's Dorcas Shikobe and Trans Nzoia Falcons goal getter Tumaini Waliaula.
