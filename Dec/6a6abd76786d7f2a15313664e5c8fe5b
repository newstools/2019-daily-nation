Seven-year-old, Public Hero (Robert Mbatha), braced himself for splish-sploshing through a lovely hydra-surface, filtering out younger contestants in the Gold Circle Trophy at Ngong on Sunday. Pubic Hero, 7, symbolised that age is meaningless when redressing a bewildered Fast Five by 8 lengths. Crowds were not afraid of El Nino's wrath. They just flocked together at this Christmassy social gathering for absorption of fresh-air and totalisator punting. People have succumbed to the demise of bookmakers, transforming energies into fancy mixed bets. Distilling promise for a new generation, Marais (James Muhindi), with self-belief brimming, took over by country miles in the Five Golden Rigs Handicap, from a weary Kidnap. Plucky Quickfire and Romeo Foxtrot, ensured The Montgomery Bowl would be much more intensive as they whooshed away from Macushla. Lady Eccles was unable to participate under Veterinary withdrawal. Onesmus Mutua was always going to snare the Seven Swans Handicap as he entered all six runners. James Muhindi struck a treble, while Robert Mbatha had fun with two. Fruity Cake was mostly evenly distributed, and the Patsy Sercombe/Mim Haynes combo did not disappoint, also on a double.
