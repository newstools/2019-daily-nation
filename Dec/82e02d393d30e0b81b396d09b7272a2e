Some 90 passengers aboard two Modern Coast buses were stranded at Sultan Hamud township in Makueni County early Wednesday morning after police impounded the buses. The vehicles were travelling from Mombasa despite an existing suspension after the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) withdrew the company's operating licence following a grisly accident that claimed seven lives in the same area a week ago. One of the buses was heading to Migori and the other to Kakamega. The bus crew have since escaped.   Each of the buses had 45 passengers on board when traffic police officers intercepted them at Sultan Hamud at 3.30 am, said Makueni County Police Commander Joseph Ole Napeiyan. "The matter is awaiting further enforcement action," Mr Napeiyan said. There was confusion after the company on Tuesday announced that NTSA had lifted the ban and allowed the buses back on the road. The roads safety agency quickly denied the claim.
