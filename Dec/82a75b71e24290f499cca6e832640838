Travellers were forced to spend the night on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway following a huge traffic snarl-up at Gilgil. The gridlock affected all lanes and caused anguish to travellers headed to various destinations. The jam started Friday evening and by Saturday 7am there were no signs of relief. Some travellers blamed police for not taking action in a timely manner.
